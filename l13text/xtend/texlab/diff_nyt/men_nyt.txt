TEXTTo the Editor: Re ''Friend of the Corporation'' (May 5), about rulings by the Supreme Court during the tenure of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.: The companies cited as beneficiaries of recent rulings by the court -- AT&T, Comcast and Wal-Mart -- are huge corporations, and their policy interests have little in common with the concerns of most American businesses. So why repeatedly call those rulings ''pro-business''? Countless small businesses will be harmed as a result of weakening antitrust law and by allowing mandatory-arbitration clauses to preclude class-action remedies. Small-business owners, like the rest of us, have no viable recourse against harm by global corporations unless they can team up to challenge abuses. Needlessly broad labels like ''pro-business'' obfuscate whose interests really are at stake.

Davenport, who has worked in the fields of knowledge management and analytics for 15 years. Data analytics is the predecessor to Big Data. He knows the context -- what's new and what's not with Big Data -- as well as anyone. Mr. Davenport, a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School (on leave from Babson College), has authored and co-authored several books on analytics, including "Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning" (with Jeanne G. Harris, Harvard Business School Press, 2007). Shortly after the Big Data phenomenon took off, Mr. Davenport said, only half-joking, that he considered simply substituting the term "Big Data" for "analytics" for updated versions of his books. But as he looked more deeply, there really was something different in Big Data. Data volumes have been steadily increasing for decades, Mr. Davenport noted, though the pace has accelerated sharply in the Internet age. "More than the amount of data itself, the unstructured data from the Web and sensors is a much more salient feature of what is being called Big Data," he said. I also asked David B. Yoffie, a technology and competitive strategy expert at Harvard, who is not part of the Big Data crowd, what he thought. The Internet, he observed, has been a mainstream technology for 15 years, and so has the ability to monitor and mine Web browsing behavior and online communications, even if those skills are much improved now. Still, Mr. Yoffie is most impressed by the rapid spread of low-cost sensors that make it possible to monitor all kinds of physical objects, from fruit shipments (sniffing for signs of spoilage) to jet engines (tracking wear to predict when maintenance is needed). "The ubiquity of sensors is new," Mr. Yoffie said. "The sensors make it possible to get data we never had before." Machine-generated sensor data will be become a far larger portion of the Big Data world, according to a recent report by IDC. The research report, "The Digital Universe in 2020," published in December, traces data trends from 2005-20. One of its forecasts is that machine-generated data will increase to 42 percent of all data by 2020, up from 11 percent in 2005. "It's all those sensors, the Internet of Things data," said Jeremy Burton, an executive vice president at EMC, which sponsored the IDC report. The implication is that Big Data technology will steadily move beyond the consumer Internet. Industrial companies like General Electric are already making big bets on the payoff. The IDC forecast also suggests that there is a lot of substance to the vision of machine-to-machine communication and intelligence that W. Brian Arthur terms "the second economy." This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.The minimum $20,000 entry fee has been paid. Fur hats and silk underwear are in the luggage. And stacks of business cards are ready to be slipped into the palms of the business and political elite gathering this week at the snowy alpine fortress that is the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. For the more than 2,500 people making the pilgrimage this year, some personalities will command more attention than others. On the Continent, where fears of the euro's imminent demise dominated thinking for the last year, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, are being credited rather than pilloried these days for saving the euro from disaster. Together with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, they will be among the keynote speakers on whether Europe's fortunes will at last take a turn for the better. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain may throw cold water on that idea, if he attends. But in Davos, if he does turn up, his main task may be to explain why investors should not be spooked by his warning that Britain may drift away from the European Union. With plenty of dynamism stirring outside Europe, emerging markets leaders will be making the case for investment dollars to flow their way. Executives and academics from China and India will swarm the halls to discuss the evolution in their economic climate, which has cooled since a year ago but remains well ahead of those in Western economies. Prime ministers from a number of African countries will also make the trek to explain how dynamism continues to build, especially on the southern part of the continent. Two years after the Arab Spring unfolded, numerous decision-makers from North Africa will outline plans for overhauls and address the political, social and economic transitions, and upheavals, in their countries. With fighting in Mali still making headlines and the Algerian gas-field hostage disaster still being sorted out, North African issues are very likely to be prime topics. Not everyone has been panting to get to Davos. Officials from the United States, for example, will barely be represented. But those coming - including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a regular at the forum, and Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations and a former candidate to be the next secretary of state - are likely to stir controversy. And some of the highest-wattage regulars are turning their attention elsewhere. Three notable absentees will be the top Google executives, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt. (For Mr. Schmidt, Davos evidently doesn't have the same allure as North Korea, where he visited recently.) Google has not said why its leaders are not attending. But some other men with big money will be on hand, though Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, can't count on quite as much money as before, now that the bank's board had decided to dock his pay after a multibillion-dollar trading loss in 2012. Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America and George Soros will all be sniffing out investments. So will Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, who has shunned Davos in the past but decided to join the party this time. It's not all about deals, though. Bill and Melinda Gates, hardy Davos perennials, will again be there to preach the need to invest in what counts for future generations: education, health and related philanthropic activity. For celebrity sizzle, the South African actress Charlize Theron will be in town to promote her Africa Outreach Project. The forum discouraged celebrities for a while after Sharon Stone stole the show in 2005 and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did the same the following year. Since then, a few stars have swanned in, mostly, it seems, out of curiosity. Last year, Mick Jagger sidled into a spate of private Davos parties wearing a velvet plum jacket and a lilac shirt, speaking eruditely about current events with people like Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, before busting a few lanky dance moves late in the evening. This year, another power broker expected to prowl the corridors is Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. Whether anyone will consider face time with him a must probably depends on a given attitude toward American baseball generally, and the widely followed Yankees specifically. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.As told to Patricia R. Olsen.  I WORKED in a business office for Verizon for seven years, but in 2006 I became one of its facilities technicians. In addition to installing fiber optic cables in people's homes, I climb telephone poles to check customers' cables and make service calls when there's a problem. For example, if one of our set-top boxes hooked to a television needs to be rebooted, I'll be assigned to do that. The chance to be outdoors drew me to this job. But beyond that, there's a sense of freedom in not being tied to a desk. Even though I work for a big corporation, my job still offers a lot of leeway. I'm still accountable, but there's no one standing over me telling me what to do. In a way, I have more freedom than people who decide to start a company because they want to be their own boss. Business owners aren't always as free as they'd like to think. They still have to work to bring in money or they won't be in business for long. I had a group of co-workers as friends when I worked in a building, but there's also a camaraderie among people who see one another on the road all the time. I wave to my Verizon colleagues, along with city workers, delivery people, postal workers and others I've come to know. Most wave back, including some technicians who work for other communications companies. You make your work friends as you can. Going into people's homes may seem more casual than working in an office, but those homes are my workplace. Not every customer understands that. Some people are shocked when they open the door and see a woman working as a technician. I'd compare it to a group of executives walking into a conference room to meet with representatives of another company. If they encounter a woman at the table, they might not always consider that she could be the president or the C.E.O. When a woman opens the door, she seems to love seeing another woman standing there. But some men don't quite know what to think. I've met a few who think that only men can do this job. They may say, ''Where's your partner?'' and I tell them it's just me. It can get dicey when I say that I'll be drilling in their houses. One customer became upset and wanted to talk to my supervisor, and I encouraged him to call. I knew that my boss would tell him that I was a top-notch technician. The man reluctantly let me continue, and, when he saw that I could do the job, he was fine. I like to think that I can handle pretty much anything, which, again, makes me feel that I'm my own boss. Whether working in an office or at another location, other women might feel strongly about gender stereotyping, but I don't take it personally. I ignore the comments. I find that a smile can overcome just about anything, so I just go about my work and keep smiling. I also have to be professional. During one appointment, a woman wanted me to watch her 3-week-old daughter while she left to pick up her other child from school. ''I really can't,'' I told her. I'm not permitted to be responsible for someone's child or to work alone in a house. I probably have even more rules when working in people's homes than I did at an office. I sympathize with office workers who have had overly neat or messy officemates. I like things extremely tidy, so I appreciate walking into a home and finding it neat and clean. That's one thing I miss about the office, where I would say something to a co-worker if I found a work area distracting or unsanitary. Instead, I now carry a hand sanitizer with me. I like working in a home where music is playing. Residents will often ask me if I want them to turn it off, but I visit diverse communities and enjoy listening to various types of music that I wouldn't ordinarily hear. OFTEN, I run into pets in people's homes. I was bitten by a dog as a teenager, so when customers have a dog, I ask them to put it in another room. ''Oh, he won't bite,'' they always say, but I insist. It's safer. Telecommuters sometimes say they become lonely working by themselves, but I never feel that way. Occasionally, one of my co-workers comes along with me during the day, but I find it easier to work alone. I'm accustomed to doing things a certain way, and, sometimes, another worker can slow me down. I can't see myself ever going back to an office.WASHINGTON -- Orders to American factories rose in May, helped by a third straight month of stronger business investment. The gains suggest that manufacturing may be picking up after a weak start to the year. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders rose 2.1 percent in May. April's increase was revised higher, to 1.3 percent from 1 percent. Most of the increase in May was because of a big jump in commercial aircraft demand. Still, businesses also ordered more machinery, computers and household appliances. A category of orders that is viewed as a proxy for business investment plans -- which excludes the volatile areas of transportation and defense -- rose 1.5 percent. That rise was even stronger than the gains in the previous two months. This measure of business investment had not increased for three straight months since the fall of 2011. The consecutive gains suggest manufacturing in the United States could improve in the second half of the year. Despite its boost to the economy in the first three years after the recession ended, manufacturing has struggled this year. American factories have seen less demand for exports because of a weaker global growth. And businesses reduced their investment in machinery and equipment in the first quarter. The May report showed that orders for long-lasting goods, like power generation equipment and ships, rose 3.7 percent in May. Orders for nondurable goods, including paper, chemicals and oil, rose 0.7 percent. Demand for commercial aircraft increased about 51 percent, after a 18.4 percent gain in April and a drop of 43.3 percent in March. Orders for autos and auto parts fell 2 percent, after jumping 4.1 percent in April, but the decline is most likely temporary. American automakers on Tuesday reported healthy sales gains in June. Ford Motor's sales soared 13 percent in June compared with a year earlier. Chrysler's sales rose 8 percent. The numbers suggest that auto production will resume a healthy pace in the next months.Stuart Elliott, the advertising columnist, answers questions from readers each week. Questions can be sent to stuarte@nytimes.com Q. Am I seeing things? The new AT&T ''business solutions'' spot with veterinarians needing more dogs and other business people seeking more customers for their various wares seems awfully similar to an American Express spot in which every vignette began with, ''I need ...'' There was also a vet in that commercial, too, as I recall. Is this a case of great minds thinking alike or borrowed interest that is too close for comfort? A. Thanks, dear reader, for your question about the AT&T commercial, which I put in front of Steve Schwadron, a senior vice president and partner at the New York office of FleishmanHillard who serves as a spokesman for AT&T on matters like advertising. Although the commercial, which promotes the company's services for small businesses, began appearing recently, according to Mr. Schwadron, it was actually produced in 2011. On YouTube, a clip of the American Express commercial is dated March 27, 2012. Putting that timing issue aside, any similarities between the two spots ''are incidental,'' Mr. Schwadron says. The AT&T commercial was created by BBDO Atlanta, part of the BBDO North America division of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group. BBDO Atlanta also creates the popular series of commercials for AT&T that carry the theme ''It's not complicated'' and feature an earnest adult talking with children. Q. I have a terrible problem with an ad that appears for a bleach. I thought I'd share this with you as it causes a lot of laughter in our house. Every time it comes on, I am in hysterics. This is where a little boy calls out joyfully to his mother that he went to the bathroom. For the life of me, I cannot get it out of my mind that he is saying, ''Mommy, I'm Mitt Romney.'' I really don't mean this to be disparaging about Mr. Romney, but that's what it sounds like to me and I still can't figure out what he is saying, hence the hysterical laughter every time I see and hear it. A. Thanks, dear reader, for your unusual question. The spot, it turns out, is for Clorox bleach, sold by the Clorox Company, and it goes by the title ''Potty.'' The youngster is actually saying, ''Mommy, I made poo poo.'' The mother, pleased, replies, ''That's great, honey,'' entering the bathroom to peer into the toilet. Viewers see a puzzled look on her face. She says to the boy, ''Where?'' He replies silently, pointing to the bathtub. Cut to a hand, slamming a bottle of Clorox bleach onto a counter. ''For life's bleachable moments,'' an announcer declares. The commercial is created by the San Francisco office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Christie Giera, director for corporate communications and North American public relations at DDB, was initially puzzled by the question. Once she checked the dialogue, she replied in an e-mail, she confirmed that the child says, ''Mommy, I made poo poo.'' ''Therefore, we don't plan to comment,'' Ms. Giera wrote. Now at one point, dear reader, it crossed my mind that you may have been pulling my leg in suggesting that Mr. Romney's name is hard to distinguish from a mild scatological euphemism. But I will give you the benefit of the doubt in that I sometimes have trouble making out dialogue in commercials because it sounds soupy or muddy. But I draw a line at answering if another reader were to ask me if I have Prince Albert in a can.LEN MARKIDAN, a 26-year-old marketing consultant based in San Francisco, is the type of business traveler who forced LodgeNet, the hotel guest-room entertainment provider, to file recently for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mr. Markidan, who spends 40 percent of his time traveling on business and is an elite participant in the Hilton and Hyatt loyalty programs, takes his MacBook Pro and iPad with him on the road and watches all television programs by streaming them on his laptop, using a portable router to extend the Wi-Fi signal in his hotel room. ''For a lot of people my age and a lot of people in general, the way we consume entertainment at home is changing,'' he said. ''I no longer have a cable subscription -- the way I watch entertainment at home is the same way I watch it on the road. I have a Hulu subscription, Amazon Prime and Netflix.'' Guest-room entertainment ''is not an amenity that will drive my decision to stay at a hotel,'' he said, adding, ''I'm a lot more concerned with loyalty program perks.'' James Lingle of Highlands Ranch, Colo., a consultant to hotel companies and guest-room entertainment service providers like LodgeNet's competitor iBahn, observed: ''If you look back, typically the first thing a guest would do when they walked into the door of a hotel room would be to turn on the TV. Now people bring their entertainment with them, tablet-based devices like an iPad, accounts and memberships like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, and they want to be able to use them.'' LodgeNet's decline directly reflects these changes. According to its bankruptcy filing, the number of hotel rooms it served globally dropped to 1.5 million in 2011 from 2 million in 2009. It provided guest-room entertainment services to most major hotel chains, usually by installing and maintaining free televisions and offering video-on-demand entertainment, for which it and the hotels received fees. LodgeNet's sales in 2011 were $421.3 million, a 21 percent drop from a high of $533.9 million in 2008. Colony Capital, a real estate and hotel investment firm in Los Angeles, led a group that invested $70 million in a controlling interest in LodgeNet, based in Sioux Falls, S.D., and brought in a management team of former Starwood, Fairmont and Hilton executives. LodgeNet, which emerged from bankruptcy in late March, also signed an agreement with DirecTV to jointly offer entertainment to hotels and hospitals. The revamped LodgeNet faces strong competition from companies including Swisscom Hospitality Services, based in Geneva; iBahn, based in Salt Lake City; Guest-Tek, of Calgary, Alberta; and Roomlinx, based in Broomfield, Colo. All are developing systems that let travelers consume entertainment the way Mr. Markidan does -- via the Internet, frequently through subscriptions they already have and use at home, either through Wi-Fi or a direct cable connection between their laptop or tablet and the guest-room television set. Different types of hotels have different policies regarding Internet access. Many less expensive hotels offer it free, while more expensive ones often charge for it. What's expected to happen next, speaking broadly, is that using the Internet for e-mail will be free, while many hotels will charge for uses requiring a lot of bandwidth, like downloading or streaming videos, with the cost tied to the amount of bandwidth required. ''We will give customers more short-form content at very attractive prices, affinity packages of sports channels, just-missed TV, video games, as well as movies currently in theaters,'' said Michael Ribero, Lodgenet's new chief executive. ''We want to give them the opportunity to watch what they want, even if it's through Netflix and Amazon Prime.'' He said LodgeNet will no longer provide television equipment in hotel guest rooms in exchange for video-on-demand fees. Instead, DirecTV will offer hotel owners lease financing for TVs, freeing capital that LodgeNet can invest in product and service improvements. C. Scott Hansen, director of guest technology for Marriott International, said his company's objective over the next several years was to connect every guest-room TV to the Internet. Marriott International also plans to limit the number of TV channels its brands offer to a targeted, all-high-definition lineup and to augment these with Internet-based, streaming content, via services like Netflix and YouTube. Bandwidth capacity at many Marriott International hotels will need to be increased to support these services, an expense Mr. Hansen said would be offset by guests' purchases of Internet access, commissions paid by services like Netflix for signing up new members and advertising revenue from companies that could use the TV or guest's laptop or tablet screen for messages. Josh Weiss, vice president of brand and guest technology for Hilton Worldwide, said his company offered a broad range of short, low-price TV programs, similar to those available from Netflix or iTunes, in many hotels, provided by LodgeNet and others. This content costs $2 to $5, far less than a full-length movie. Hilton Worldwide also offers a free, DirecTV service similar to DirecTV's residential service at over 150 hotels across most of its brands and plans to expand this service this year. Mike Blake, chief information officer of Commune Hotels and Resorts, said the company was considering keeping track of guests' channel preferences, which would automatically come up whenever a guest turned on the TV in the hotel room. He said this service, which guests could opt in for, should be available by the fourth quarter of this year. Other new services under consideration include the ability to customize music playlists for guests and to stream personal photos on guest room TVs. Apple TV in hotel rooms at the Aloft Cupertino, a Starwood hotel, lets guests play video and music and display photos from any Apple device on their television set. Starwood is evaluating offering this system and additional entertainment options at other Aloft and Starwood hotels. CitizenM, a Dutch chain of what it calls ''affordable luxury'' hotels -- now all in Europe, with two slated to open in Manhattan this year and next -- provides a Samsung tablet in each guest room, with technology from Swisscom that provides a music library and free video-on-demand TV and also controls the blinds, lighting and temperature. The 85-year-old Peninsula Hong Kong this month will finish installation of a guest-room entertainment system that Ingvar Herland, Peninsula Hotels' general manager of research and technology, said costs $10,000 to $25,000 a room. This proprietary system features fully customizable bedside and desk tablets preset in a choice of five languages, with six more to follow this year. The tablet allows the guest to order room, concierge and housekeeping services, and to control lighting, curtains, the temperature and privacy options. It also provides -- via a flat-screen, Blu-ray, LED television -- terrestrial programming, 90 international television channels, 450 Internet radio stations, free HD and 3-D movies, as well as free international voice-over-Internet protocol telephone calls. Mr. Herland said the new system would be offered at the Peninsula Paris, opening next year, and would eventually replace existing systems at other Peninsula hotels. Travelers should not expect a proliferation of new services like the Peninsula's, said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. He said that although hotels in the United States this year were expected to spend a record percentage of profits on capital expenditures -- like entertainment systems -- profits per room also were expected to remain well below their 2006 peak. Companies offering new systems ''that are expensive for hotel owners are doing so at a challenging time,'' he said, adding that many hotel owners would consider premium cable service as an alternative. One vanishing option is sex-related entertainment. Omni banned such programs in 1999, citing its support of ''pro-family issues,'' while Marriott International stopped offering it last year. ''If you want it, you can access it online on your own,'' said Mr. Hansen of Marriott.N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.  OVER the last few weeks, as the stock market has reached new highs, my thoughts have turned to my 85-year-old mother. ''O.K. Mr. Smarty-Pants,'' she often asks me, ''what stock should I buy now?'' She first asked me this question when I was an undergraduate at Princeton, majoring in economics. She asked again when I was a graduate student at M.I.T., earning a Ph.D. in economics. And she has asked it regularly during the last three decades when I have been an economics professor at Harvard. Unfortunately, she has never been happy with my answers, which are usually evasive. Nothing in the toolbox of economists makes us good stock pickers. Yet we economists have written countless studies about the stock market. Here is a summary of what we know: THE MARKET PROCESSES INFORMATION QUICKLY One prominent theory of the stock market -- the efficient markets hypothesis -- explains how answering my mother's question would be a fool's errand. If I knew anything good about a company, that news would be incorporated into the stock's price before I had the chance to act on it. Unless you have extraordinary insight or inside information, you should presume that no stock is a better buy than any other. This theory gained public attention in 1973 with the publication of ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' by Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economist. He suggested that so-called expert money managers weren't worth their cost and recommended that investors buy low-cost index funds. Most economists I know follow this advice. PRICE MOVES ARE OFTEN INEXPLICABLE Even if changes in stock prices are unpredictable, as efficient markets theory suggests, we should be able to explain these changes after the fact. That is, we should be able to identify the news that causes stock prices to rise and fall. Sometimes we can, but often we can't. In 1981, Robert J. Shiller, a regular contributor to this column and an economics professor at Yale, published a paper in The American Economic Review called, ''Do Stock Prices Move Too Much to Be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Dividends?'' He argued that stock prices were too volatile. In particular, they fluctuated much more than a rational valuation of the underlying fundamentals would. Mr. Shiller's paper prompted a storm of controversy. My reading of the subsequent academic literature is that his conclusions, though not all his techniques, have survived the debate. Stock prices seem to have a life of their own. Advocates of market rationality now say that stock prices move in response to changing risk premiums, though they can't explain why risk premiums move as they do. Others suggest that the market moves in response to irrational waves of optimism and pessimism, what John Maynard Keynes called the ''animal spirits'' of investors. Either approach is really just an admission of economists' ignorance about what moves the market. HOLDING STOCKS IS A GOOD BET The large, often inexplicable movements in stock prices might deter someone from holding stocks in the first place. Many Americans, even some with significant financial assets, avoid stocks altogether. But doing so is a mistake, because the risk of holding stocks is amply rewarded. In 1985, Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott, both now at Arizona State University, published a paper in the Journal of Monetary Economics called ''The Equity Premium: A Puzzle.'' They pointed out that over a long time span, stocks have earned, on average, about 6 percent more per year than safe assets like Treasury bills. This large premium, they said, is hard to explain with standard economic models. Sure, stocks are risky, so you can never be certain you'll earn the premium, but they are not risky enough to justify such a large expected return. Since the paper was published, economists have made some limited progress in explaining the equity premium. In any event, the large premium has convinced most of us that stocks should be part of everyone's financial plan. I allocate 60 percent of my financial assets to equities. Stocks may be an especially good deal today. According to a recent study by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, given the low level of interest rates, the equity premium now is the highest it has been in 50 years. DIVERSIFICATION IS ESSENTIAL Every time a company experiences a catastrophic decline -- consider Enron or Lehman Brothers -- reports emerge about employees who held most of their wealth in company stock. These stories leave economists slapping their heads. If there is one thing we know for sure, it is that sensible financial management requires diversification. So, if you have more than 5 percent of your assets in any one company, call your broker and sell. Doing otherwise means exposing yourself to extra risk without extra reward. SMART INVESTORS THINK GLOBALLY One widely documented failure of diversification is what economists call home bias. People tend to invest disproportionately in their home country. Most economists take a more global perspective. The United States represents a bit under half of the world's stock portfolio. Because Europe, Japan and the emerging markets don't move in lock step with the United States, it makes sense to invest abroad as well. Which brings me back to my mother's question: If I could pick just one stock for someone to buy, what would it be? I would now suggest something like the Vanguard Total World Stock exchange-traded fund, which started trading in 2008. In one package, you can get low cost and maximal diversification. It may not be as exciting as trying to pick the next Apple or Google, but you'll sleep better at night.HOW many 45-year-old upper-level managers want to bone up on high school geometry and grammar? Not too many. So perhaps it's not surprising that in the global competition for executives willing to invest weekends in an E.M.B.A. program, a growing number of top business schools no longer require an entrance exam. Until this year, the French business school Insead required the Graduate Management Admission Test. ''We were at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Kristen Lynas, director of the school's executive degree programs. ''The majority of our competitors either don't require the GMAT or are willing to waive it.'' But Insead wanted an exam to ensure that the student body could keep up. Ms. Lynas is blunt: the GMAT is best for 20-something M.B.A.'s. Insead began offering an alternative to the GMAT last February. The biggest departure is a presentation based on a business scenario that applicants prepare in a half-hour, then deliver. The test strives to eliminate language that flummoxes nonnative English speakers, as well as rule-based questions that demand test prep. Forgot the Pythagorean theorem? No problem. The focus is business math, and international commerce. Ms. Lynas says applications are up 60 percent, and a majority chose to take the in-house E.M.B.A. over the GMAT. Prep Zone, a test-prep company founded by two Insead alumni, developed the exam for Insead. Under a spinoff company, Business Test Methods, they're taking the idea on the road as the Business Aptitude Test. Their first clients are the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin and the Indian School of Business, which are offering the test beginning in March. Daunted by the GMAT?

''As our business model evolves, so must our organization,'' Jan Hommen, left, the ING chief executive, said in a statement. The bank reported that fourth-quarter profit rose 21 percent to 1.4 billion euros, or $1.9 billion, from the period a year earlier, missing the estimate of 1.6 billion euros expected by analysts surveyed by Reuters. DAVID JOLLY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS Switzerland said on Wednesday that Swiss banks would be required to hold additional capital for residential mortgages amid concerns that the country's booming property market was overheating. The country, which already has more stringent capital rules than other European nations, said lenders would be required to hold an additional 1 percent of risk-weighted assets to make the financial system more stable. JULIA WERDIGIER OVERSIGHT INSIGHT A top regulator shed light Wednesday on his decision to scuttle an independent review of bank foreclosures. At a speech in Washington, Thomas J. Curry, the comptroller of the currency, left, said that homeowners languished without any payment as the reviews suffered from delays. The consultants that banks hired to run the 14-month review, however, billed for some $2 billion in charges. BEN PROTESS TARGET SURPASSED The venture capital firm Lux Capital said on Wednesday that it had closed its third fund at $245 million, the biggest pool of capital it has raised to date. Lux, which focuses on investments in the energy, technology and health care industries, said it had surpassed its fund-raising target of $200 million. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED nytimes.com/dealbookGE Capital, General Electric's lending arm, recently stopped offering consumer financing programs to retailers whose main business is selling guns, in response to the ''industry changes, new legislation and tragic events.'' The move, said a GE Capital spokesman, expanded on a policy established in 2008. That year, GE Capital stopped offering new consumer financing for purchases of guns from gun shops, but existing relationships with gun shops were grandfathered in and those programs continued. Fewer than 75 retailers are affected by the recent policy change, a fraction of 1 percent of gun retailers in the United States, said the spokesman, Russell Wilkerson. The terminated financing programs, as a business, were ''immaterial'' to the company, he said. The lending cutoff applies only to retailers whose primary business is selling guns, Mr. Wilkerson said. GE Capital is still offering financing to other retailers who sell many different kinds of merchandise, including guns. Those retailers range from Walmart to sporting goods chains. The change in GE Capital's lending policy to the gun stores was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. The move by GE Capital comes in the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. General Electric, the giant industrial and finance company, is headquartered in Fairfield, Conn., and some employees have children in the Sandy Hook elementary school, where the tragedy occurred. Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook gunman, was the son of Peter Lanza, an executive at General Electric.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.  ENCOURAGING homeownership has been considered a national goal at least since ''Own Your Own Home Day'' was introduced in 1920 by various business and civic groups as part of a National Thrift Week. The newly popular word ''homeownership'' represented a goal and a virtue for every good citizen -- to get out of the tenements and into one's own home. Homeownership was thought to encourage planning, discipline, permanency and community spirit. In the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis, our national commitment to homeownership is sure to be questioned as we consider what to do about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the enterprises that are meant to increase the supply of money available for mortgages and are now under government conservatorship; the Federal Housing Administration, which directly subsidizes homeownership; and the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program, which was intended to lower interest rates. For both political and economic reasons, any or all of these encouragements for homeownership -- not to mention the mortgage interest deduction -- could be sharply curtailed. Which is why this is a good time to ask a basic question: In today's world, is it wise for the government to subsidize homeownership? In answering it, we have to look at the big picture by considering all the presumed advantages of owning a home, including the encouragement of thrift that animated the founders of ''Own Your Own Home Day.'' Consider Switzerland, which by several accounts has had one of the lowest rates of homeownership in the developed world. In 2010, only 36.8 percent of Swiss homes housed an owner-occupant; in the United States that same year, the rate was 66.5 percent. Yet Switzerland is doing just fine, with a gross domestic product that is 4 percent higher, per capita, than that of the United States, according to 2011 figures produced at the University of Pennsylvania. It's not that the Swiss inherently prefer renting. A 1996 survey asked a sample of Swiss whether, if they could freely choose, they would rather be homeowners or renters. Eighty-three percent said homeowners. CERTAINLY, many of us have a basic drive to create our own habitats. We enjoy personalizing our living spaces, inside and out. But there are also important practical advantages to renting to consider -- especially when asking if government should support or discourage homeownership. For example, renters are more mobile. That means they are more likely to accept jobs in another city, or even on the other side of a large metropolis. In addition, it's hardly wise to put all of one's life savings into a single, highly leveraged investment in a home -- as millions of underwater borrowers today can attest. So why the difference in American and Swiss homeownership rates? According to a 2010 study, ''Why Do the Swiss Rent?'' by Steven C. Bourassa at the University of Louisville and Martin Hoesli at the University of Geneva, tax policy provides much of the explanation. For example, owner-occupants in Switzerland pay income tax on what is known as the imputed rent they derive from living in their own homes -- yes, they pay tax on the rent they could be charging themselves. This imputed rent is estimated by looking at market rents for similar properties. In the United States, taxation of imputed rent was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1934. (Britain tried such a tax but abandoned it in 1963.) And, given the likely resistance to any new tax, it is highly unlikely that the idea could re-emerge anytime soon, however sensible it might be. But we do have the option of cutting back on government incentives to own rather than rent. Beyond tax policy, we need to look at landlord-tenant law. Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Hoesli contend that Switzerland's law in this area is relatively attractive, compared with those of other countries. In the United States, it is administered by 50 separate states, so treatment of renters is confusing to national economic commentators. The law, of course, should offer congenial ways to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. But it should also ensure that people's various concerns about renting -- about possible evictions and rent increases, for example, -- are handled well. There was a revolution in American landlord-tenant law in the 1960s and '70s, focusing on the inequities facing minority groups. But since 1972, there has been no major update of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act issued by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Perhaps there should be another revolution in this body of law, focused on making renting more rewarding to people of every background and income level. Last week, it was good to see that one agenda item for the commissioners, meeting in Boston, was to discuss proposals to revise the law to make the rental process work better. We should also remember that a goal of ''Own Your Own Home Day'' was to emphasize thrift. And it is still true today that most people don't save enough. In a 2011 paper, James M. Poterba of M.I.T., Steven F. Venti of Dartmouth and David A. Wise of Harvard showed that retirement saving in most American households was inadequate and that most households nearing retirement in 2008 had most of their wealth in home equity. Many people don't save much unless a regular schedule of mortgage repayment, which builds home equity, enforces it. The 2011 paper argued that the home-equity portion of saving tends to be conserved until very late in life after retirement, thus providing insurance against the risk of living longer than expected. THUS, encouraging homeownership in the past encouraged better saving plans. And yet the Swiss, without such encouragement, manage to have a high household saving rate. Our national policy needs to take away much of the enormous subsidy to homeownership -- but if and when it does so, it will have to find some other way to promote proper saving.Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist, is the founding president and C.E.O. of the Center for Talent Innovation in Manhattan and the author of ''Forget a Mentor, Find a Sponsor,'' forthcoming from Harvard Business Review Press.  AS Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook tells it, what accounts for her spectacular leap to leadership is her unfettered embrace of career opportunity. By ''leaning in,'' she maintains in her new book, she has been able to join the male-dominated ranks of corporate executives. But it's simply not enough for a woman to put her self-doubt aside, grab hold of ambition and aim for the top, as Ms. Sandberg advises. A woman needs someone to lean in with her. That's according to recent research by the Center for Talent Innovation, an organization I founded that focuses on advancing women and minorities. To get ahead, women need to acquire a sponsor -- a powerfully positioned champion -- to help them escape the ''marzipan layer,'' that sticky middle slice of management where so many driven and talented women languish. Our two-year study, which sampled some 12,000 men and women in white-collar occupations across the United States and Britain, shows how sponsorship -- unlike mentorship, its weaker cousin -- makes a measurable difference in career progress. Mentorship, let's be clear, is a relatively loose relationship. Mentors act as a sounding board or a shoulder to cry on, offering advice as needed and support and guidance as requested; they expect very little in return. Sponsors, in contrast, are much more vested in their protégés, offering guidance and critical feedback because they believe in them. Sponsors advocate on their protégés' behalf, connecting them to important players and assignments. In doing so, they make themselves look good. And precisely because sponsors go out on a limb, they expect stellar performance and loyalty. A sponsor can lean in on a woman's behalf, apprising others of her exceptional performance and keeping her on the fast track. With such a person -- male or female -- in her corner, our data shows, a woman is more likely to ask for a big opportunity, to seek a raise and to be satisfied with her rate of advancement. Ms. Sandberg does talk about the importance of mentors and sponsors in her book, but she doesn't really distinguish between the two, nor does she discuss the measurable benefits of sponsorship. Just look at what sponsorship did for Ms. Sandberg. Clearly, she brought a great deal of achievement to the table, but as she acknowledges, she also secured a champion in the form of Lawrence H. Summers, who selected her as his research assistant. She followed him to the World Bank and the United States Treasury, where she ended up, at 29, as his chief of staff. This, in turn, positioned her for a megawatt career, making her visible to the likes of Eric Schmidt at Google and then Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. It's not easy to find a sponsor. You need to earn this kind of investment. ''Sponsorship only works when it's a two-way street,'' says Patricia Fili-Krushel, chairwoman of the news group at NBCUniversal. ''It can't be just 'Gimme, gimme, gimme -- I need help, I need advice.' '' You must demonstrate that you'll deliver outstanding performance -- ''you've got to consistently make your boss look good,'' she says. ''Trust is at the heart of this relationship,'' says Kerrie Peraino, global head of talent at American Express. ''When I put my faith in up-and-coming talent and become their sponsor, I need to know I can totally depend on them -- because they are, after all, walking around with my brand on.'' It's in this area of trust that women and minorities often fail to get the help they need. When it comes to figuring out whom to sponsor, senior leaders -- typically white men -- most readily turn to the people they feel most comfortable with. Most often, that means other white men. Employers need to work to counteract this natural tendency. SINCE we started our research, companies that have created paths to sponsorship include American Express, AT&T, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deloitte, Genentech and Morgan Stanley. They recognize that while powerful advocacy needs to be earned, potential sponsors need to be better apprised of who is worthy of their investment. While sponsorship can't be forced, it can be made more transparent and accessible to high-potential employees who aren't white and male. It doesn't quite take a village, but breaking into the white-boys' club takes more than individual effort. No matter how fiercely you lean in, you still need someone with power to lean in with you.PARIS -- European demand for new cars slumped in January to the lowest level on record for that month, industry data showed Tuesday, as sales at Ford Motor's troubled operations on the Continent tumbled by more than one-fourth. New-car registrations, a proxy for sales, fell 8.7 percent from January 2012, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported in Brussels, falling to 885,159 units, the lowest level since the organization records began in 1990. Global automakers are hoping for a decent 2013, but they worry that the European market will continue to decline. Consumers have been slammed by recession, unemployment and government austerity measures. In many countries with good public transportation, driving is a pleasure rather than a necessity, and high joblessness among young people has the industry fretting that an entire generation will not adopt the car lifestyle. Carlos Ghosn, Renault's chairman and chief executive, has estimated that European car sales will fall at least 3 percent this year. The car and light vehicle market contracted 8.2 percent in 2012 to just more than 12 million units, the lowest level since 1995. The United States, in comparison, has gotten off to a fairly strong start this year, with sales having gained 14 percent in January from the same month in 2012. Emerging markets are also expected to post good growth. In Europe, the biggest decline in January was posted by Ford Motor, where sales fell 25.5 percent. Ford said last month that its annual loss in Europe -- its second-biggest market after North America -- could climb to as much as $2 billion this year. Volkswagen, the largest European automaker, posted a 5.2 percent decline in January. The European sales of PSA Peugeot Citroën, the troubled French company that ranks No. 2 in the European Union, fell 16.3 percent, while its rival Renault dropped 5.6 percent, and Renault's Japanese alliance partner, Nissan, dropped 6 percent. General Motors' sales fell 5.5 percent. Toyota Motors' sales fell 16.8 percent. The luxury automakers continued to gain in January, for the most part, with Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz, adding 3.7 percent from 2012 and BMW adding 6.6 percent. Jaguar Land Rover sales rose 19 percent. The data include all 27 E.U. countries except Malta. Only Britain, where sales rose 11.5 percent from 2012, bucked the tide in major markets. Germany, the biggest European market and long one of the healthiest, turned decisively lower, with sales falling 8.6 percent. French sales declined 15.1 percent, and Spanish sales slumped 9.6 percent. Even larger declines were seen in the Netherlands, down 31.2 percent; Greece, down 34.5 percent; and Finland, down 28 percent.This interview with Brooke Denihan Barrett, co-chief executive of Denihan Hospitality Group, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. Tell me about the first time you were somebody's boss. A. I grew up in the family business, so one of my first paying jobs was working at the front desk of a hotel. I thought the way you got things done was by telling people what to do. That's where I learned what not to do. I spent a good portion of my time telling people what they did wrong instead of really encouraging them about what they did right. I used to think that was just the way that you managed people -- telling people what they were doing wrong. As I got more comfortable with my own skills and grew to understand that nobody is perfect, I learned to cut people a little slack. But early on, people would shudder when I walked into a room, thinking that I was going to find something negative. Q. How did you learn to take a different tack with people? A. It was trial and error, and really watching as other people came into the organization. I realized that you get a lot more with the carrot routine than the stick routine. I also realized that you really needed to explain the ''why'' of things. You need to give people a little bit of space to come around, and say, ''Yeah, that makes sense,'' before you really engage them in what needed to be done. Q. Other leadership lessons? A. To listen a lot. It's easy to say that you listen, but active listening -- really listening for understanding -- is something you learn over time. Because sometimes you don't see people's body language. They might be saying one thing, but they mean another thing. That's something you just learn by observing. Q. What's a bit different about your company's culture? A. We're celebrating our 50th anniversary in the hospitality business this year. And if there is one word I would use to describe our culture, it would be family, because we are a family-owned and -operated business. But I always have to be careful when I use that word ''family,'' because a lot of times it can be misinterpreted as taking care of people to the point of not holding them accountable. You have to set certain standards that you want people to live up to. And if people need help, then we want to help them along the way. I think people naturally want to do the right thing, and do their jobs well. Sometimes organizations can fall down if they don't also ask: How do you give people the tools they need to be successful? How do you get that person to understand what change needs to happen, and how do you help them along the way? Because people can't always figure it out on their own, and nor should you expect them to. Q. What else about your culture? A. We do something called round tables where we meet with our associates in small groups of maybe 10 or 12 people. I love to say to them, ''Tell me something I don't know.'' And I'll get comments like: ''Oh, but you know everything. You're the C.E.O.'' It's just a reminder of the perceptions that people have of the head of the company. But every time I ask that question, I learn something new. Q. Other lessons you've learned over time? A. One is, count to 10 before you say something. It's especially true with e-mail today. People will share something and it causes terrible repercussions. You have to remember to take a deep breath when somebody says something that really ticks you off. A lot of times the context in an e-mail is so different than when you pick up the phone. And you shouldn't ''cc'' the world, and don't hit ''reply'' to everybody. That drives me nuts. Q. A lot of C.E.O.'s I've interviewed talk about the reluctance of people to have difficult conversations. How do you handle them? A. We've tried something called ''lessons learned'' conversations. And we've had them facilitated a few times. So we might bring people together in a room who were involved in a project and ask: What were the things that worked? What were the things that didn't? What could we have done differently? And we've had some very spirited and cathartic conversations. You have to be able to let people put something on the table without actually pointing the finger. It allows things to come out in more of a nonaccusatory manner. Q. Have you received any feedback over the years, especially since you've become C.E.O., that prompted you to adjust your leadership style, even in a small way? A. I like details, so I will say a lot, ''Give me the facts, Jack.'' Because I feel so strongly about it, I might come across as being closed or defensive. So I really have to be mindful of my body language. When someone is saying something that I disagree with, I'm good at the listening part of it, but if I don't really like what that person is saying, I have to be careful that my body language doesn't stop the conversation. I have to make sure it continues to flow. Q. Let's shift to hiring. What questions do you ask? What are you looking for? A. By the time somebody meets me, you can assume that the skills are there. So what I interview for is fit. And I'm always very curious to know, what is it about our company that appeals to that person? There are people who are very professional interviewees. Every question you ask them, they nail it. But you kind of want people to not be perfect in their replies, because that makes them real people. You have to be authentic. We're all works in progress. We have to improve each and every day. Because once you've become satisfied, you lose that urgency and that hunger to be better. Q. What other questions do you ask? A. How do you define culture? What kind of organizations have you worked for? What do you think is special about this culture? Tell me about a mistake that you've made, and how you dealt with it. How do you view yourself? If someone were to talk about you in the third person, how would they describe you? This interview has been edited and condensed.A COUPLE of weeks ago, my laptop died. My stomach churned as I realized that a full day's worth of work had vanished. ''Maybe I could just ask the National Security Agency for a copy of it,'' I said to myself. ''They have everything now.'' I didn't know which surveillance bureaucrat to call, and that's a shame. Because, let's face it: The era of Big Data is upon us, and it turns out to be the era of Big Snooping. In the business world, every corner-office visionary worth his M.B.A. is proselytizing about the miracle of data. Tech wizards comb Google searches and Twitter posts to find out what consumers want. That data is being used to sell stuff, everywhere. My bank statement now has ads for Burger King that show up next to the debit card purchase at Five Guys. When I do a Google search for old-fashioned wall phones, ads for old-fashioned wall phones start showing up next to my Facebook feed. Every company seems to have collected every bit and byte about me. And, as it turns out, so has Uncle Sam. Not only does the federal government seem to be grabbing data we freely give away on Facebook and Twitter and through Google searches, the N.S.A. has gone further, gathering records of e-mails and phone calls. Yes, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are all big in cloud computing. But compared with what the N.S.A. is compiling, those companies have made the merest wisps of cirrus clouds, high and hazy in the sky. There has been some hand-wringing by privacy advocates, sure, but much of the rest of the population seems willing to let government look just about anywhere it wants if that might help avert the next terrorist attack. I'm upset about it, but largely because some N.S.A. dudes know that I call my mother every night. They might taunt me by calling me a mama's boy. But thinking about the government's prying eyes led me to a happy thought: I can get filthy rich from the government's endless appetite for data. A run-of-the-mill tech investor might buy shares in the makers of computers and data storage, because those server farms don't build themselves. Some smart guys are pouring money into Big Data analytics companies like the felicitously named Splunk. Power companies, which feed those ever-growing server farms, are always a good bet, too. But I say we should kick it up a notch. Consider this: Let's give people a chance to buy back their own data. The government has already scarfed it up. So let's set up a back door in its spy-central computer network to help people find those missing Instagram photos. Or to remind them to call their mothers if phone-company records show that it's been awhile. It's our data, after all. We all ought to get some use out of it. And if somebody makes a profit -- and by somebody, I mean me -- isn't that just the glory of the marketplace? I called an expert in Big Data just to kick the intellectual tires. Henry Kautz heads the department of computer science at the University of Rochester and studies ways to use things like Twitter messages to track flu outbreaks. Astonishingly, while he said he supported data monitoring to catch terrorists, he had reservations about my idea. ''I would definitely be opposed to the federal government in any way selling or leasing information that they have collected for national security purposes,'' he said. Experts! Clearly, his opinion won't stop me. After all, if I don't do it, somebody else will. Once we get started, there has to be an additional income stream in selling advertising around your data in this networked world. Let's go back to my Burger King example, and supersize it. You call your wife to talk about dinner. The keywords in the call prompt an ad placement, and suddenly your computer's speaker crackles to life: ''How about grabbing a sack of Whoppers on the way home?'' (The N.S.A. assures us that the content of messages and phone calls isn't being collected, but roll with me here, because even if they don't do it now, it could happen before long. Privacy invasion is like that, especially when it's done to defend our freedoms.) When you get into your car, the online guidance system greets you with this: ''That Whopper sure sounds good, no? They'll throw in a side of fries if you show up in the next 10 minutes. But don't break the speed limit -- the black box will know, and a traffic ticket will be in your e-mail when you get home.'' See? A real service to the taxpaying consumer, and it's barely creepy at all. If history is any guide, the American people won't even grumble about this little intrusion into their private lives -- so let's intrude just a little more. The government already tracks the financial markets. And it monitors corporate communications closely. How about using a little of that inside information to balance portfolios more wisely and make the markets really efficient -- at least for those of us willing to pay? Why not start an N.S.A. mutual fund? Who wouldn't want a stake in that? The government can help us become financially secure, even if we're feeling insecure in every other way. And the hedge-fund version of this fund, for those with big bucks, would basically be an all-access pass to all the information in the cloud. Don't call it insider trading -- call it rewarding the entrepreneurial spirit. The fees alone could help balance the federal budget; after all, the government should be as good at collecting dollars as data. The more information that is out there, the greater the opportunity ''to serve man,'' as Rod Serling once put it in a ''Twilight Zone'' episode about a cookbook from another planet. Just think of the possibilities opened by gizmos like the Fitbit, which monitor your sleep, calories burned, and even the number of steps you take each day. It's a treasure trove. Here's where it gets really cool: it all comes together in a little algorithm I'd like to call a ''modest data proposal.'' Let's say my Fitbit shows that I'm getting into shape and my medical and insurance records suggest that I have no big health problems like heart disease or stroke ahead of me. In fact, I'm likely to live to 100. But my bank account and investment data show that I haven't built up a financial cushion for a lengthy retirement. At this rate, I'm almost certain to end up becoming a drag on Social Security and the health care system. Under my plan -- let's call it the lifestyle death panel -- the government would recommend that I take up smoking. That would shorten my life and help keep entitlement spending under control. I'll bet that tobacco companies might even pay for the ads. Or, as an alternative, Uncle Sam could encourage me to eat Triple Whoppers.Apple and Samsung Electronics are sucking up every penny of profit in the handset business. But Samsung's mobile business is growing fast, and the question is: Could it surpass Apple in profit next quarter? Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, an investment research firm, think so, according to a new report. The report, issued on Monday, said that in the first quarter of the year, Apple took 57 percent of profit in the handset business, while Samsung took 43 percent. That shows substantial growth for Samsung's phones. For comparison, in the first quarter last year, Apple raked in 74 percent of profit, and Samsung took 26 percent. In the report, Michael Walkley, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said he believed that in the June quarter, slowing sales of the iPhone combined with strong sales of Samsung's new flagship phone, the Galaxy S4, may catapult Samsung to the top spot. If that were the case, it's unclear whether Samsung would temporarily take the throne only until Apple introduces a new iPhone. Samsung's growing market share, especially in foreign markets like China, India and Russia, has analysts speculating that Apple must introduce a cheaper iPhone, on top of its premium model, to retain its lead. Laurence Isaac Balter, chief market strategist at Oracle Investment Research, which has clients that own Apple shares, is concerned about the Cupertino company's future. The reason: Samsung makes so many different models of phones, and many customers are being lured to its Galaxy phones, which have bigger screens than all of Apple's iPhones. That's where Apple missed the boat, he said. ''Is the current iPhone size the future or is the larger screen?'' Mr. Balter said. ''The market is clearly saying the larger screen. People, when they're faced between the two, are choosing the larger screen.'' Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment on the report. But he pointed to the company's last earnings call, where the company warned that its gross margins would probably continue to fall in the fiscal third quarter, dropping to between 36 and 37 percent. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.British authorities have opened an investigation into Hewlett-Packard's claims that it was duped when it bought the business software maker Autonomy, according to regulatory documents filed Monday. The inquiry, by the British Serious Fraud Office, is the latest legal fallout from a deal that has saddled Hewlett with huge losses and depressed its stock price. The Justice Department started looking into the matter late last year, shortly after H.P. accused Autonomy employees of fabricating sales in a ruse that drove up the company's sale price. Autonomy's founder and former chief executive, Mike Lynch, has stridently denied H.P.'s claims and demanded that the company provide more evidence. H.P., which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., bought Autonomy, based in Britain, for about $10 billion in 2011 and then wrote off $8.8 billion of that amount late last year in a move that stunned Wall Street. At least eight lawsuits have been filed by H.P. shareholders saying that the company's board and management botched the Autonomy deal and concealed vital information before the giant write-off. The turmoil also threatens to upend H.P.'s board. Two shareholder advisory firms are recommending votes against the re-election of H.P.'s two longest-serving directors, John Hammergren and G. Kennedy Thompson, at the company's annual meeting on March 20. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Company say the two directors should be ousted for poor oversight of the Autonomy deal and other recent H.P. acquisitions that have turned out badly. I.S.S. also is recommending that shareholders oppose the re-election of the company's chairman, Ray Lane. Glass Lewis is pushing for the removal of two other H.P. directors, Marc Andreessen and Rajiv Gupta, whose tenures on the board are the next longest after Mr. Hammergren and Mr. Thompson.RÜSSELSHEIM, GERMANY -- As they prepare to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, top managers of General Motors sought to dispel any doubts about the company's commitment to its unprofitable Opel unit in Europe, reiterating plans to invest billions in new models and break even by the middle of the decade. ''We are more convinced than ever that G.M. must have a strong presence in Europe generally and particularly -- especially -- here in Germany,'' Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said Wednesday at the Opel headquarters in Rüsselsheim, near Frankfurt. Several hundred Opel employees crowded onto balconies overlooking an atrium in the office building where Mr. Akerson and other G.M. executives spoke. The workers applauded after Karl-Thomas Neumann, Opel's fourth chief executive since 2010, vowed that, ''Opel is back!'' G.M. is the fourth-largest automaker in the European Union measured by number of cars sold, including the Chevrolet brand. But Opel, sold under the Vauxhall brand in Britain, has been among the manufacturers hit hardest by a relentless downturn in European auto sales that began in 2011. Sales of Opel and Vauxhall in Europe fell 16 percent in February from a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, while market share slipped to 6.1 percent from 6.4 percent, less than half of what the market leader, Volkswagen, claims. A few months ago some auto executives were predicting that European sales were close to hitting bottom, but there is no sign of a revival yet. Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, said Wednesday that it might need to reassess its sales forecasts for 2013 because of the prolonged slump in Europe. G.M.'s board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday in Rüsselsheim, site of a large Opel factory and design center. It was the first time the board had met in Germany for at least two decades, company representatives said. The board's presence was probably intended to help correct the widespread impression among Germans that G.M. regarded Opel as an unwanted stepchild. Mr. Akerson's appearance had the quality of a state visit. He arrived for a press event in Rüsselsheim with an entourage that included the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Philip D. Murphy, and the prime minister of the state of Hesse, Volker Bouffier. Mr. Akerson will meet Thursday with Ms. Merkel, but neither G.M. nor the chancellor's office has said what is on the agenda. Mr. Akerson repeated a promise to invest &#x20ac;4 billion, or $5.2 billion, in Europe through 2016. The money will be used to introduce 23 new models and variants of existing models, as well as 13 new engines. ''Opel is paving the way for the biggest turnaround in the history of the European auto industry,'' Stephen J. Girsky, vice chairman of G.M., said at the event Wednesday. But Opel has yet to prove that the latest turnaround attempt will achieve better results than previous efforts. Opel has not reported a profit since the 1990s. Its employees have suffered waves of job cuts and there is currently a wage freeze in effect at German plants. Opel plans to close down vehicle production at a plant in Bochum, Germany, as early as next year. But Opel appears, at least, to have finally achieved détente with workers after years of strife that helped tarnish the brand's image. Wolfgang Schäfer-Klug, chairman of the workers' council at Opel, spoke at the event Wednesday, expressing gratitude for what he said was a clear commitment from G.M. Mr. Bouffier, the state prime minister, noted that many previous turnaround plans failed. ''We have often had hopes that a short time later were disappointed,'' he said at the event. But he expressed optimism that this time could be different. ''No company invests &#x20ac;4 billion in such a short time unless it believes in the future,'' Mr. Bouffier said. After the speeches were over, the executives and political leaders moved outdoors where they stood in a stiff wind and revealed a slab of concrete that was once part of the Berlin Wall. The graffiti-covered slab will stand in front of the headquarters to encourage workers to overcome obstacles, Opel said, and as a symbol of the new era that the company hopes lies ahead. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.OUR annual list of highly compensated executives includes some astonishing salaries. But they are not necessarily the richest compensation packages out there. We rely on filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission for public companies. That means we are missing entire categories of businesses: privately held corporations, most hedge funds and many private equity firms. Some sleuthing shows that payouts given to private equity titans and hedge fund managers were often significantly higher than that of the mere mortals on our list. Four of the largest private equity firms -- the Carlyle Group, Apollo Global Management, the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company -- went public in recent years, a move that required them to begin disclosing executive pay. Their executives don't show up on our main list because we look only at companies with total revenue of more than $5 billion. Unlike executive pay at most corporations, much wealth here is derived from their ownership stakes in these firms, and, each year, they get payouts based on their stakes. Distributions at private equity firms are analogous to dividends corporations pay shareholders, said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School and a columnist for DealBook. Private equity executives may also hold direct ownership stakes in the funds managed by the firm, so distributions from those funds wouldn't necessarily show up in the public data, he noted. If all of the distribution payouts were factored in, some of these executives' pay packages would dwarf those on our list. Consider Leon Black, C.E.O. of Apollo Global Management, among the largest private equity firms with $2.86 billion in 2012 revenue. He took in more than $125 million last year. A tiny piece -- $287,000 -- was from salary and other base compensation. The bulk was from distributions based on the 92.7 million shares he owns in the firm, according to Equilar calculations. Steve Schwarzman, founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, took in $8.4 million in compensation last year, and his distributions earned him an additional $204 million. ''Mr. Schwarzman has a salary and does not take a bonus,'' said Peter Rose, a Blackstone spokesman, in response to Equilar's research. ''He gets dividends on his Blackstone stock, just like the public, and he gets his share of the gains in the funds he invests in. His interests perfectly match up with our fund investors and our public shareholders.'' The wealth of executives at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was harder to determine, because it disclosed only distribution payouts on common units and not on the convertible ownership units held by top executives. But even excluding those payouts, the two co-chiefs at K.K.R., Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, made more than $35 million each in compensation. These large payments would not be obvious to the casual reader of proxy statements. Only the salary, bonuses and certain other pay like stock grants are listed plainly on the annual compensation tables in S.E.C. filings. To determine the big dividend payouts, Equilar pieced together information in other parts of the company's annual report. A spokesman at Apollo Global declined to comment on its compensation, and representatives for Carlyle and K.K.R. did not reply to requests for comment. HEDGE fund managers typically prize secrecy. Only a handful of hedge funds -- including Och-Ziff, Fortress Investment and Oaktree Capital Management -- are publicly traded and thus required to disclose their executive pay packages. Each year, AR magazine estimates hedge fund managers' pay based on the fees they charge clients as well as the change in value of their personal stakes. In 2011, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, had an estimated payday of $3.9 billion (yes, billion with a ''b''), according to AR magazine. The activist investor Carl C. Icahn was estimated to have earned $2.5 billion in 2011. The 2012 list will be published in the coming weeks. By comparison, the publicly traded hedge funds paid their C.E.O.'s relatively meager amounts. Oaktree Capital's president, Bruce Karsh, made about $12.2 million in base compensation and about $64 million in distributions in 2012. (Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.65 billion.) To be fair, many hedge fund managers have most of their wealth tied up in the funds themselves. For instance, Steven A. Cohen, one of the consistently top-paid hedge fund managers, owns more than half of the estimated $15 billion in assets managed by his firm, SAC Capital.When Glenn A. Britt got started in the nascent cable television business in the 1970s, no one knew whether people would pay a monthly fee for something that was already available free through an antenna. Nowadays, most Americans do pay companies like Mr. Britt's Time Warner Cable, not just for television, but for broadband Internet, too. Keeping Americans paying, though, will soon be someone else's job. Time Warner Cable, the country's second-biggest cable company after Comcast, said on Thursday that Mr. Britt, its chief executive since 2001, would retire at the end of the year, capping several years of succession discussions and months of talk about a departure. Mr. Britt, 64, will be succeeded by Robert D. Marcus, who at 48 represents a generational change both for the company and the industry. Mr. Marcus has been in line for the top job since 2010, when he was named president and chief operating officer. Mr. Marcus will take over a company that has been transformed in the 12 years Mr. Britt has been in charge. Once known just for piping cable television into homes, Time Warner Cable now considers its main product to be broadband, and it is trying hard to sign up businesses to offset the residences that have switched to DirecTV or Verizon FiOS. In an interview, Mr. Marcus said that his priorities would include residential subscriptions, the corporate culture and overall customer service. ''We've got to develop a level of emotional connection with our customers,'' he said, so that the company is not competing on price alone. While gaining TV subscribers will be ''challenging,'' as Mr. Marcus put it, because of stiff competition (the company had 12.2 million subscribers at the end of last year, up from 9.2 million when Mr. Britt took over in 2001, but the number has been declining for several years), there is more potential on the broadband side. Time Warner Cable had 11.4 million broadband subscribers at the end of last year, up sharply from 1.4 million at the beginning of Mr. Britt's tenure. But growth there slowed in the first quarter, and it will be watched closely when the company reports second-quarter earnings Aug. 1. ''We can do better,'' Mr. Marcus said. Mr. Marcus's words may reverberate on Wall Street, where investors approved of the distributor's 2009 spinoff from the content-oriented Time Warner -- its stock is up more than threefold since -- but want to see subscription figures improve. Looming over all of this is John C. Malone, whose recent acquisition of a stake in Charter Communications and subsequent talks with Time Warner Cable about a possible merger have bolstered the stocks of both. Time Warner Cable rebuffed the approach by Mr. Malone, partly because Charter has barely four million subscribers. Given cable's economies of scale, ''smaller companies would benefit from being part of a bigger company,'' Mr. Britt said in an interview. But the benefits for the bigger acquirer ''are harder to figure out,'' he said, ''which is why you haven't seen us be more aggressive.'' Mr. Britt did not bring up Mr. Malone's name directly, and would not describe any conversations they have had. He said his retirement plan had no bearing on the company's reaction to Mr. Malone, who continues to pursue ways to consolidate the cable industry. Mr. Marcus, similarly, said: ''In the abstract, there is a potential for consolidation to increase value to the total ecosystem, but the key for us is not simply for creating it for the ecosystem, it's about creating it for our shareholders. That's where the decision process often gets more challenging.'' In an interview in his corner office overlooking Central Park, Mr. Britt was humble, talking much more about his company's achievements -- it had total revenue of $21 billion last year; the year Mr. Britt took over, it was $6 billion -- than his own. He cast his retirement as a normal part of corporate life and an opportunity for him to pursue other interests. ''It's actually not healthy for somebody to stay too, too long,'' he said. Succession talks involving Mr. Britt and the company's board started even before Mr. Marcus was promoted to chief operating officer in 2010. Mr. Marcus had been chief financial officer, playing a pivotal role in the Time Warner separation. ''This is the kind of handoff you see on a long relay race -- where it's done gracefully and without anybody losing a beat,'' said N. J. Nicholas Jr., the board's lead director. Mr. Marcus's ascension was announced as negotiations were extended between Time Warner Cable and the CBS Corporation over a new carriage contract. The deadline, previously Thursday, is now Monday, at which time CBS could be blacked out in three million subscribers' homes. The two sides have tried to blame each other for the possible blackout using advertisements and social media forums. Mr. Britt said he would like to see ''more restraint across the board'' on the matter of rising programming costs. He said he did not foresee any immediate existential threats to the cable television bundle, despite occasional calls for à la carte pricing and the growth of on-demand libraries like Netflix. Of the possibility that Intel, Google or another technology company will come into the marketplace and sell a bundle of cable channels via the Internet, Mr. Britt said, ''It's not clear to me that you could make very much money going that route, and maybe not any money.'' New entrants to the market would not receive better rates for programming than established companies, he said. Mr. Britt sounded skeptical about the concept that households would drop cable en masse for Internet alternatives, known as cord cutting. But he said: ''I think there is one thing we don't know. That is whether the young generation now, called the millennials, are going to behave differently than all the generations before them.'' That is, will their TV viewership and cable subscriber levels pick up as they age, or not? The answer may depend on the television industry's willingness to adapt. One of Mr. Britt's favorite phrases lately is ''four anys,'' a reference to making any video available anytime, anywhere and on any screen, but today it is more theory than reality. ''The technology is available to do all that, and we're trying to get as close to that as we can,'' he said, suggesting that it could happen as fast as channel owners allowed it to happen. He said he was not disappointed by the pace of change, however: ''I actually think it's moving along probably as fast as these things move along. We'll look back 10 years from now and say, 'Look what's happened.' ''The board at News Corporation approved a proposed split into two companies on Friday, and authorized a $500 million stock buyback for investors in the soon-to-be-formed publishing business. It also announced appointments to the board for both of the companies. The company is expected to complete its separation on June 28, with publishing assets like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and HarperCollins, and a handful of Australian pay television units, forming a company that will retain the name News Corporation. Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX and the Hollywood film and television studio will form an entertainment company to be called 21st Century Fox. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, called the board's approval of the split a ''significant step in creating two independent companies with the world's leading portfolios of publishing and media and entertainment assets.'' The announcement may do little to dispel criticism that the News Corporation board is too heavily made up of members of the Murdoch family. After the division Mr. Murdoch will serve as chairman of both companies. He will maintain his role as chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Murdoch's two sons, James and Lachlan, will be directors of both companies. But the boards will also include new faces. Robert Thomson, as chief executive of the new News Corporation, will join the publishing company's board, as will Ana Paula Pessoa, a partner at the public relations firm Brunswick Group; Masroor Siddiqui, managing partner of the investment firm Naya Management; and John Elkann, chairman of Fiat. Joel I. Klein, chief executive of News Corporation's fledgling Amplify education division, will maintain a role on the company's board. Chase Carey, president and chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, will join several new directors -- Delphine Arnault, a French businesswoman and deputy general manager at Christian Dior Couture; Jacques Nasser, a former chief executive of the Ford Motor Company; and Robert S. Silberman, executive chairman of Strayer Education Incorporated -- on the entertainment company's board. ''New blood is always a good thing for a company as it tries to overcome'' scandals like the phone hacking crisis in Britain that News Corporation has gone through, said Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, a charitable organization and institutional investor that owns 3,686 shares of News Corporation's Class B voting shares. But, Ms. Campos added, ''We're anxious to see how these directors will demonstrate their commitment to all the News Corporation shareholders and not just the Murdoch family.'' News Corporation also said on Friday that it expected to report at least a $1.2 billion pretax, noncash impairment charge related to its publishing division this quarter.To the Editor: Re ''The Charitable-Industrial Complex'' (Op-Ed, July 27): Peter Buffett concludes that many funders of the rapidly growing nonprofit sector condition their support on the application of business principles -- like investing where the return on investment is highest. There's some truth to this, but it's also worth remembering that a good many funders still pay little or no attention to what their donations actually accomplish as they pass through the hands of nonprofit managers. It's a crime to waste money, however well intentioned. Somewhere between the benign neglect of traditional charity and the blind acceptance of benefit-cost analysis is a sweet spot for philanthropists of all stripes to move toward. RAY HORTON New York, July 27, 2013 The writer is a professor of ethics and corporate governance and founder of the Social Enterprise Program at Columbia Business School. To the Editor: I have worked for more than 30 years in the nonprofit and for-profit sector, primarily in Africa. Peter Buffett's simple sentence -- ''My wife and I know we don't have the answers, but we do know how to listen'' -- is profound and refreshing, and very, very unusual. Most Westerners I've met who are trying to help the ''less fortunate'' don't listen. They diagnose, prescribe and, often, as Mr. Buffett points out, create disastrous unintended consequences. These are well-meaning people and organizations, but the simple act of listening is not part of their skill set. Sadly, almost every negative consequence from earnest efforts -- like the indiscriminate distribution of free mosquito nets or drilling water wells in the middle of villages, to name two -- could be avoided by simply listening. The people who are the targets of our help know their problems and they know the solutions. They're not waiting for us to diagnose the problem, much less force-feed them the solutions. They'd like us to listen and then work with them to provide the resources, whatever those may be, to solve the problems. So yes, there is, as Mr. Buffett says, ''a crisis of imagination.'' But before one even gets to imagination, one needs to listen to the people one is trying to help. PETER V. EMERSON London, July 29, 2013 The writer is a director of the Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund and a visiting research fellow at King's College London. To the Editor: Peter Buffett laments that the nonprofit field isn't producing breakthrough answers and has a ''crisis of imagination.'' I disagree. Nonprofits involved in public change may not have the answers for worldwide teenage pregnancy, health care, education and the other global issues he mentions. But society grows primarily through small changes that can prove themselves -- not sudden big answers. A few examples from the program for nonprofit leaders that I run: faster ways to get elderly to the hospitals; better ways to stop lead poisoning in urban housing; ways for professionals who have continuing education requirements to use that time to help the needy. The problem is that solutions like these often involve the need to press government to act. But foundations tend to stay away from public advocacy, afraid that they will be accused of lobbying (but public advocacy is allowed) and not wanting to pay for time-consuming efforts that may take several years to yield results, if ever. If foundations began to finance public advocacy -- and just small grants are needed -- there could be thousands more changes for the good happening, and some might eventually become the large breakthroughs we all want. ALLAN LUKS New York, July 27, 2013 The writer is the director of the Fordham Center for Nonprofit Leaders. To the Editor: Philanthropy's elephant in the room is that charity targeting the rich-poor gap comes from sources that have produced this gap. Peter Buffett insightfully shows how giving does more to soothe the donor's conscience than to mitigate inequality. Often but not always. Many nonprofits from coast to coast are redressing inequality. They efficiently use their contributions to provide second chances to Americans who have dim prospects for moving their lives forward without help -- like offering kids an enriched early childhood education, mentoring at-risk youth or enabling the chronically homeless to move into permanent housing. They are proof that philanthropy can indeed be a vehicle for significant change. They do not, in Mr. Buffett's words, ''only kick the can down the road.'' They're offering gateways to the American dream. IRA SILVER Framingham, Mass., July 29, 2013 The writer, a professor of sociology at Framingham State University, is the author of ''Giving Hope: How You Can Restore the American Dream'' and blogs at www.oppforall.com.NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar -- Foreign executives who flew into this dirt-poor country over the past year to tap into what is described as Asia's last major frontier market often came away skeptical, befuddled or outright disappointed. ''Look, listen, learn -- and leave'' was the catch phrase that described trips here by executives who saw first-hand the lack of electricity, terrible roads, eager but very undereducated work force and overwhelmed government officials. Now, two years after Myanmar's civilian government came to power, the country appears to be moving into another stretch of its journey from military dictatorship to democratic market economy. Flirtations by foreign investors are turning into commitments, vague promises into dollars. Some of the world's most prominent multinational companies -- Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Electric, Philips, Visa -- have started doing business in the country. ''We're prepared to be very patient,'' said John G. Rice, a vice chairman of General Electric, who attended a World Economic Forum conference of foreign executives in Naypyidaw that concluded Friday. G.E. has leased aircraft and sold medical machinery and turbines in Myanmar in recent months and announced it would donate $7 million worth of training to engineers and health care workers. The overall scale of the company's investment remains small. G.E. opened an office earlier this year with considerable fanfare but it has only two employees in the country. ''The world is getting used to the fact that Myanmar is no Shangri-La,'' said Peter Maher, the head of Southeast Asian operations for Visa. ''This is frontier stuff,'' he said. ''We take it on faith that there will be a market here.'' Since December, when automatic teller machines were reintroduced into the country, the number of A.T.M.'s accepting international credit cards has gone from zero to 160 and spending by foreign cardholders in the country has totaled about $7 million. But as a measure of the still tiny size of the market here, in neighboring Thailand, which has a similar population but a much more developed economy, foreign cardholders spent 400 times as much during the same time period -- about $3 billion, Mr. Maher said. Companies from China and other Asian countries have long had a strong presence in Myanmar, but with the lifting or suspension of European and American sanctions, Myanmar is increasingly turning to the West for assistance in building a country that was impoverished by five decades of military rule. One of the biggest tests of the country's ability to attract investors is the auction for mobile phone licenses scheduled to be completed later this month. Fewer than 10 percent of the people in Myanmar have mobile phones, compared with 80 percent in neighboring Bangladesh. Jaspal Bindra, the group executive director of Standard Chartered Bank, said the winners of the mobile phone licenses would need to invest billions of dollars. ''That's where you will see investment dollars quicker than later,'' he said. Companies selling food and other consumer goods are also moving quickly. For decades, packaged food and drinks have been imported -- and smuggled -- into the country from Thailand and China; companies are now seeking to move production here. Daniel Sjogren, managing director of Carlsberg Myanmar, is presiding over the construction of a brewery in Bago, a city an hour and a half outside the country's commercial capital, Yangon. With annual consumption of beer in Myanmar about five liters, or little more than one gallon, per person, compared with 20 liters per person in a more developed territory like Hong Kong, the brewer anticipates years of growth. But Carlsberg's investment plans also underline some of the challenges foreign companies face in setting up operations. Yangon, where Mr. Sjogren is moving with his family, is strained by the influx of foreigners. He had difficulty getting his two young children enrolled in an international school and the house he has rented in Yangon is only marginally less expensive than the apartment he is leaving in Hong Kong, one of the world's most expensive cities. ''If you want a decent house in an area of Yangon with secure electricity, you're talking $10,000 a month,'' he said. Electricity supply is also an issue at the planned brewery in Bago -- the company must install its own electricity supply. U Soe Thane, a minister and key aide to President Thein Sein, does not hesitate when asked the most frequent complaint by foreign investors: ''Electricity,'' he replies. Only 13 percent of households have access to electricity, according to a report released earlier this month by McKinsey, the international consulting firm. ''Without electricity it's just talk,'' said Mr. Rice of G.E. ''Just about everything you do requires a plug.''General Mills reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that were better than expected after sales volume of its core brands rose for the first time in two years. Shares in the company, which makes Cheerios cereal, Progresso soups and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, rose 3 percent. So far this year the shares are up 19 percent, with much of that coming after the deal by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital for H. J. Heinz, which has generally raised valuations for many food companies, Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones, said. Mr. Russo said General Mills had been performing better in some of its challenged businesses, including cereal and yogurt. ''It looks like they're reinvesting back into the business, which is always smart,'' Mr. Russo said. Excluding the benefit from the recent acquisitions of Yoki Alimentos in Brazil and Yoplait Canada, General Mills said sales by volume rose 1 percent. That is its first gain for that measure since the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Since then, the company had raised prices on many of its products to offset commodity cost inflation, which hurt sales. ''We think the consumer environment is improving,'' the chief executive, Ken Powell, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''As the price comparison moderates, the consumer is coming back.'' In the third quarter, ended on Feb. 24, net income rose to $398.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from $391.5 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items like the costs of valuing commodity hedges and integrating recent acquisitions, earnings were 64 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters Sales rose 7.5 percent to $4.43 billion. Excluding the acquisitions, sales grew 2 percent, with a percentage point coming from higher sales volume. General Mills lifted its full-year outlook by only a penny a share because of higher costs in the current fourth quarter related to a comparatively higher tax rate and commodity costs. The company said fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than a year ago. General Mills shares rose $1.19, to $47.61, on the New York Stock Exchange.Feeling pressure from consumer and labor groups for not doing more to ensure factory safety in Bangladesh, Wal-Mart, Gap and numerous other retailers along with the nation's main retail federations are seeking to forge a new plan to promote safety in that country's apparel industry. This effort, to be spearheaded by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit group based in Washington, was announced on Thursday, two and a half weeks after dozens of retailers and apparel companies, almost all of them European, announced a far-reaching plan aimed at ensuring factory safety in Bangladesh. As part of the new effort, the National Retail Federation, the American Apparel and Footwear Association as well as Gap, JCPenney, Sears, Target, Wal-Mart and other retailers, will seek to ''develop and implement a new program to improve fire and safety regulations in the garment factories of Bangladesh,'' according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. This effort will be led by two prominent members of that group, former Senators George J. Mitchell, a Democrat, and Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, both from Maine. But some labor advocates called the effort divisive and a sham. After a factory building collapsed in Bangladesh on April 24, killing at least 1,127 workers, Western retailers faced more pressure than ever to take action to ensure factory safety in that country, the world's second-largest apparel exporter after China. In response, H&M, Carrefour, Marks & Spencer and more than two dozen other European companies backed a binding plan in which they agreed to rigorous independent inspections of the factories they use in Bangladesh and to help finance improvements for fire and building safety. Only a few American retailers signed on, however. On Thursday, Sean John, the fashion company run by Sean Combs, announced that it would become the third United States company to join, following PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Loblaw, a Canadian retailer that produces the Joe Fresh clothing line, has also joined that plan. With about 40 companies signed on to that plan, Gap, the Children's Place and several other American retailers have faced protests and a flood of Facebook posts, urging them to join. Bill Chandler, a Gap spokesman, welcomed the new effort. ''We see the American alliance as a powerful path forward,'' he said. Jessica Deede, a Target spokeswoman, said, ''We have been engaged with the Bipartisan Policy Center's initiative as a potential solution.'' The center said Mr. Mitchell, Ms. Snowe and the North American retailers would seek to release their plan by early July. The effort also includes the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the Retail Council of Canada. In assessing the new plan by American retailers, Richard M. Locke, an expert on overseas manufacturing at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., said, ''I think they must be feeling the heat because people are asking them, 'Why don't you join this other initiative?' '' Professor Locke added: ''The idea that you would bring all these people together in this new effort is a good first step. But I don't think it's good to have competing initiatives.'' Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of Uni Global Union, a worldwide federation of 20 million retail and service workers that helped develop the initial Bangladesh factory safety plan, criticized the new effort. ''It's a sham,'' he said. ''There is no valid reason why they can't join the initiative we have launched. It has been well received,'' he said, adding, ''Now they seem to want to paddle their own canoe on their own terms.'' Officials from several American retailers have voiced concern that their companies would face large legal liability if they were to join the European-dominated plan. But several backers of that accord say the Americans are shying away because they dislike the binding obligations and potential costs of the plan. On Wednesday, officials from Wal-Mart, Gap and several other retailers met in New York to begin moving ahead with the plan. Kevin Gardner, a Wal-Mart spokesman, lauded the effort, saying, ''There is a need to partner with other stakeholders to improve the standards for workers across the industry.'' Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory monitoring group, said the new effort would ''contain no real obligation on the part of brands and retailers to pay for the building renovations necessary to convert deathtraps in Bangladesh into safe factories.''Accounts ¶The United States division of Pret a Manger named Walrus, New York, to handle advertising assignments that include digital marketing, in-store marketing and event marketing.

Financial terms were not disclosed.Sprint Nextel, wanted as an acquisition by both SoftBank of Japan and Dish Network, posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, but its customer growth suffered as its Nextel network wound down. Sprint, the No. 3 American wireless provider after Verizon and AT&T, recorded higher-than-expected revenue, but it said the Nextel network shutdown was stunting growth in its remaining network because large business customers were leaving. Sprint added only 12,000 customers to its network, compared with the analysts' average estimate of almost 198,000 customers. The company's top priority is to persuade Nextel customers to move to the Sprint network ahead of the shutdown at the end of this quarter. Some Nextel business clients also canceled subscriptions to Sprint's remaining network, the company's chief executive, Dan Hesse, told analysts in a conference call. Including the Nextel network defections, Sprint lost 560,000 subscribers, compared with the analysts' average estimate of a loss of almost 525,000. By contrast, Verizon Wireless, the top American cellphone company, added 677,000 subscribers in the quarter, and the second-ranked AT&T added 296,000. Sprint reported that its first-quarter loss narrowed to $643 million, or 21 cents a share, from $863 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected on average a loss of 33 cents a share, according to those surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Sprint's revenue rose to $8.79 billion from $8.73 billion. Analysts had expected $8.71 billion. The company now expects 2013 adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization to reach the high end of its previously announced goal of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding costs of closing strategic transactions. Sprint's board is evaluating a $25.5 billion acquisition offer from Dish, a satellite TV service, which has challenged the company's October agreement to sell 70 percent of itself to SoftBank for $20.1 billion. During a conference call with analysts, Sprint did not comment on the Dish offer but it said the SoftBank deal could close as soon as July 1.PEOPLE already worried about the candid cameras on Google Glass and low-flying drones can add a new potential snooper to the list: cameras on inexpensive, low-orbiting microsatellites that will soon be sending back frequent, low-cost snapshots of most of Earth's populated regions from space. They won't be the first cameras out there, of course. Earth-imaging satellites the size of vans have long circled the globe, but those cost millions of dollars each to build and launch, in part because of their weight and specialized hardware. The new satellites, with some of the same off-the-shelf miniaturized technology that has made smartphones and laptops so powerful, will be far less expensive. The view from high up is rich in untapped data, said Paul Saffo, a forecaster and essayist. He expects the new satellite services to find many customers. Insurance companies, for example, could use the satellites' ''before'' and ''after'' views to monitor insured property and validate claims after a disaster. Businesses that update online maps for geologists, city planners or disaster relief officials could be customers, too. The images could also be used to monitor problems like deforestation, melting icecaps and overfishing. And food companies and commodities traders could use the images to keep track of crops and agricultural yields all over the planet, Mr. Saffo predicted. But the images are also likely to be viewed as the latest mixed blessing by people already apprehensive of Big Brother-like surveillance in their lives. First into space in the microsatellite business will be the San Francisco company Planet Labs, which plans to launch a fleet of 28 small satellites at the end of the year that will photograph the planet around the clock, with frequent updates. The company has already sent up two trial satellites for test runs, and will dispatch the entire set, called Flock-1, in December, said Will Marshall, a co-founder of the company and a former NASA scientist. The Planet Labs' satellites won't be able to distinguish your face or read your license plate -- the cameras don't have that level of resolution. But the frequency with which images can be updated could raise privacy questions, said Timothy Edgar, a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University and a former director of privacy and civil liberties in the Obama administration. Mr. Edgar contrasted the satellite images with those provided by Google Earth -- the ones that people zoom in on to see, for example, an aerial view of their homes.''That's just an image of your house that was probably taken a few years ago,'' he said. ''It may feel like you are being watched, but you aren't. It's just a static picture that's most likely several years old.'' But a satellite that regularly passes over your cabin deep in the woods and photographs a car that is sometimes parked there -- and sometimes not -- has different ramifications. ''It can show a pattern, for example, when you appear to be at home and when you're away,'' he said. Planet Labs' technology, like that at other microsatellite companies such as Skybox Imaging, are benefiting from the progressive miniaturization of consumer electronic components, along with a federal effort to commercialize space. ''What we are seeing are smaller satellites that have similar capabilities to much larger, traditional satellites,'' said Glenn Lightsey, a professor at the University of Texas who founded and directs the Texas Spacecraft Lab there. ''Since putting a satellite in orbit is a function of its size, these new satellites are able to get into orbit at a much lower cost,'' he said. The lightweight satellites have another advantage: the companies don't have to spend millions of dollars for a rocket to get them into space. Instead, they can hitch a ride as a secondary payload on a rocket already making the trip. Planet Labs will send its satellites on an Antares rocket when it heads out on a cargo transportation flight to the International Space Station. Investors have flocked to the new satellite companies, though neither Planet Labs nor Skybox Imaging has disclosed what it will charge customers. Planet Labs has obtained $13.1 million in funding, led by Steve Jurvetson, managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Other backers include O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Data Collective and First Round Capital. Five ground stations will receive the Planet Labs imagery as the satellites pass overhead. Dr. Marshall would not disclose how often the satellites would pass the same spot. ''The point is that by putting up lots of satellites, we can image the whole Earth on a much more frequent basis,'' he said. Skybox Imaging, in Mountain View, Calif., aims to provide sharply detailed images as well as high-definition video with its satellites. The company, which has raised about $91 million, expects to put its SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 satellites into orbit later this year, said Dan Berkenstock, a co-founder, and then follow with a group totaling 24 satellites. Customers will be able to buy images or an appliance to download information directly from the satellite. ''They can log onto our satellite and ask it to take pictures,'' he said. Japan Space Imaging, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Corporation, recently signed a contract with Skybox allowing it to directly downlink imagery for agricultural and maritime monitoring as well as for disaster response. Microsatellite services promise a new, accessible way to monitor global changes such as crop growth, said Anthony Janetos, director of Boston University's Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future. ''You can't understand these forces if you can't measure them,'' he said. ''These services will be useful in gathering those measurements.'' The new satellites are yet another stage in the expansion of the human view aided by powerful cameras and digital communication, said Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New York University and author of ''The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.'' This change has pluses and minuses, he observed. People who try to build a private hideaway in the woods might come to realize that it isn't so private. But such images could also spot illegal logging in remote spots. ''Now we can have a Godlike view, looking down from the heavens,'' he said. ''I can understand why people would be nervous. But the cameras can make the world more transparent and open. I'm for that.'' E-mail: novelties@nytimes.comTOKYO -- Lifted by strong sales in the United States and a weaker yen, Toyota Motor on Tuesday raised its profit forecast for the full financial year by 10 percent, to 860 billion yen, as the company, the world's largest automaker, recorded a return to profit levels it has not seen in years. Toyota said net profit was 99.9 billion yen, or $1.1 billion, in the three months through December, a 23.5 percent increase from results a year earlier, when the effects of the Japanese tsunami still weighed on its business. Sales for the quarter climbed 26 percent, to 16.2 trillion yen, helped by a surge of almost 50 percent in sales of the company's fuel-efficient vehicles in the United States. Cost reductions at the automaker, already known for its lean production, saved 320 billion yen during the quarter, the company said in a statement. Now Toyota, whose Super Bowl ad ''Wish Granted'' topped viewership rankings, is set to get a wish of its own: the weaker yen, brought about by the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office late last year, is set to lift Toyota's bottom line even further. A weak currency helps Toyota because it lowers the cost of producing in Japan and inflates the yen value of overseas profits. Toyota is poised to get a particularly big lift from the weak yen because it manufactures more cars at home than its domestic rivals. Last year, Toyota made 53 percent of its vehicles in Japan and exported more than half of those cars. Toyota shares have risen by almost 50 percent since mid-November, when the yen started to weaken. The currency has weakened by about 15 percent during the same period. In 2013, Toyota expects to sell 9.91 million vehicles, improving on its record of 9.75 million last year, which helped it regain its crown as the world's top-selling automaker from General Motors. Those sales figures include Daihatsu Motor and Hino Motors, which are part of Toyota Group. Such a performance could help Toyota get closer to the 1.7 trillion yen in net profit it reported in 2008, before the global financial crisis decimated its earnings. Since then, a recall scandal, natural disasters and a strong yen have hindered a full comeback. But the combined challenges have also led executives at the 75-year-old automaker to revamp quality control, cut costs and take more risks with design. ''We believe that our efforts have been bearing fruit,'' Takahiko Ijichi, Toyota's senior managing officer, said in the statement on Tuesday. ''We are finally on the road to sustainable growth.''Jamie Dimon has long had a complicated relationship with private equity. Since taking over as chief executive of JPMorgan Chase in 2005, Mr. Dimon has gradually reduced the bank's exposure to the risky business of buying and selling companies. On Friday, Mr. Dimon announced that JPMorgan's last remaining private equity unit, One Equity Partners, would be spun out into a separate company and raise its next fund as an independent firm. The move comes as banks are facing regulatory pressure to reduce their exposure to risky businesses, but the divestment of One Equity, which manages $4.5 billion of the bank's money, was not in response to that, according to a person briefed on the matter. Instead, this person said, the decision is a reflection of JPMorgan's emphasis on its client businesses rather than making investments off the firm's balance sheet. Last year, the bank was buffeted by a multibillion-dollar trading loss by its chief investment office in London. The One Equity business is the legacy private equity arm of Bank One, the Ohio bank that Mr. Dimon ran and sold to JPMorgan in 2004. At that time, JP Morgan had two other private equity divisions -- JPMorgan Partners, a unit that made a broad range of investments, and Corsair, an arm that invested in financial services. Mr. Dimon took over as chief executive of the combined company in 2005. That year, the bank surprised Wall Street by keeping the smaller One Equity Partners and splitting off the bigger business. JPMorgan Partners is now an independent private equity firm called CCMP, and Corsair was spun out in 2006 into an independent firm. One of the bank's reasons for de-emphasizing its private equity investments -- especially the ones that were made by its largest unit, JPMorgan Partners -- is that it didn't want to be in businesses that directly competed with some of its prized private equity clients, like Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. JPMorgan's investment bank has a very lucrative business both advising and making loans to the world's largest buyout firms. One Equity was started in 2001 by Dick Cashin, its managing partner and a former Olympic rower. Among the firm's more successful deals were its buyout of the health care company Quintiles and its acquisition of Polaroid out of bankruptcy. Jacques Nasser, the former chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, is a One Equity senior executive. The firm will continue to manage its existing portfolio of investments for JPMorgan, and sell them off over time. ''I have worked with the team at OEP for the past 12 years and have a lot of respect for all that they have accomplished and the great value they have delivered to the firm,'' Mr. Dimon said in a statement. JPMorgan's decision to divest itself of One Equity comes as the debate over the Volcker Rule drags on. The passage of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in 2010 placed restrictions on how much capital banks could invest in hard-to-sell assets like private equity. A number of banks have jettisoned much of their buyout operations, including Bank of America and Citigroup. But with the continued uncertainty surrounding the Dodd-Frank law, others have maintained their private equity arms, like Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Morgan Stanley Global Private Equity. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.LOS ANGELES -- A green car start-up, Coda Holdings, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday after selling just 100 of its all-electric sedans. The filing with the federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware will allow the Los Angeles company to get out of the auto sector and refocus on energy storage, a far less capital-intensive business. The company uses the same technology it used in cars to build systems for utilities and building operators to store power. A group of lenders led by Fortress Investment Group plans to extend debtor-in-possession financing and will seek to acquire the company for $25 million through the bankruptcy process, Coda said in a statement. Coda introduced its five-passenger electric car in California a year ago, delivering a range of 125 miles, or 200 kilometers, on a single charge. The $37,250 vehicle was criticized for its no-frills styling, and its short history also included a recall because of faulty air bags. Consumers have been slow to gravitate toward electric vehicles as a result of their high cost, and fears about their driving range. Just three years ago, Coda was one of an emerging crop of California start-ups, including Fisker Automotive and Tesla Motors, seeking to build emission-free electric cars to appeal to mass-market consumers. Investors poured money into the sector, and Coda raised $300 million in equity from backers, including Aeris Capital, the Limited Brands chief executive Les Wexner, and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. However, in 2012 the company withdrew its request for $334 million in federal loans like the ones Fisker and Tesla received. As the allure of electric vehicles faded, Coda struggled to secure new private funding. Last year, Coda sought to raise $150 million but clinched just $22 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla has put thousands of cars on the road, but Fisker is considering a bankruptcy filing. The maker of lithium-ion batteries for Fisker, A123 Systems, filed for bankruptcy late last year. General Motors and Nissan Motor also invested heavily in electric vehicles. Coda has about 40 active employees and expects to recall 50 furloughed workers. Emerald Capital Advisors is advising Coda on its restructuring, and Houlihan Lokey is its investment banker.ECONOMIC REPORTS Data to be released this week include retail sales for July (Tuesday); the producer price index for July (Wednesday); the Consumer Price Index for July, industrial production for July, weekly new claims for unemployment benefits and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's business outlook (Thursday); and housing starts for July and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment for August (Friday).

JEFFREY CANE and STEPHANIE STROM NEW CHECKS After spending two years and millions of dollars to temper a regulatory crackdown, the world's biggest banks are now resigned to a wave of new oversight. By New Year's Eve, 65 banks had registered their derivatives businesses with regulators and turned over extensive real-time trading data to outside warehouses, fulfilling a central rule of the Obama administration's financial regulatory overhaul. Late on Wednesday, a warehouse also posted an early batch of data online, shining a rare spotlight on an opaque business that was battered in the 2008 financial crisis. Until now, regulators had little authority and little information to scrutinize the minutiae of derivatives trading, a vast market that totals more than $600 trillion. BEN PROTESS nytimes.com/dealbookWASHINGTON -- The fresh round of federal spending cuts scheduled to begin next week would slow economic growth in the next year, though not nearly as much as going over the so-called fiscal cliff might have, economists said. The cuts -- a result of a policy known as sequestration -- most likely would reduce growth by about one-half of a percentage point in 2013, according to a range of government and private forecasters. That could be enough to again slow the arrival of a recovery, producing instead another year of sluggish growth and high unemployment. Such economic forecasts are even cloudier than normal because of uncertainty about the cumulative impact of the rounds of federal spending cuts and tax increases in the last few years. Whether the government's repeated flirtation with fiscal turmoil is causing businesses to postpone or reduce planned investment is also unclear. Some evidence suggests that companies, particularly in the military industry, cut investment last year in anticipation of sequestration, which was originally scheduled to begin Jan. 1. The Commerce Department estimated that the economy shrank slightly in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained relatively strong last year, but may have weakened early this year after an increase in payroll taxes, part of a deal to avoid the worst of the fiscal cliff tax increases and to delay its spending cuts. ''Where are all the customers? And where's their money?'' a Wal-Mart executive wrote in a February e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News, bemoaning a sharp decline in sales. Wal-Mart sales accounted for more than 2 percent of domestic economic activity in recent years. Many economists are particularly critical of the arbitrary nature of the cuts, arguing that Congress could reduce annual deficits by the same amount with far less economic damage by spreading the cuts across a broader range of programs, directing them at lesser priorities or giving government agencies more discretion in how they make them. ''There's a better way to do this,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting company based in St. Louis. Still, he and others emphasized that the impact would most likely not be nearly as bad as the cost of the tax increases and spending cuts that had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. ''Even though it's bad policy, the macro effects are small compared with going over the fiscal cliff,'' he said. ''That was a recession. This is a deceleration.'' The cumulative effect of the sequester and the tax deal struck in January might slash economic growth by as much as 1.25 percentage points -- from a growth rate that otherwise might have been more than 3 percent -- in 2013, economists estimate. Mr. Prakken predicts that the economy still would grow at about the same 2 percent annual pace it has managed in the years since the recession. Sequestration would slash agencies' ''budget authority'' by about $85 billion, but the Congressional Budget Office this month estimated that actual outlays would fall by only about $44 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, with the rest accruing over time. That is still about 1 percent of total federal spending to be squeezed out in a matter of months. Many economists argue that the same cuts could be made with less pain by postponing some of them until later in the decade, when the economy is likely to be stronger. Many argue that growing spending on health care programs like Medicaid and Medicare is the real threat to the federal budget, not domestic spending on areas like education and support for poor families. They also argue that macroeconomic estimates of the impact on growth probably understate the damage that will be caused by cutting spending indiscriminately. ''It's the nature of the cuts that is most pernicious -- across-the-board, without thought, cutting everything and anything including programs everyone thinks are good and effective,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''It's impossible to calculate in terms of dollars and cents what you're doing when you have these mindless cuts.'' The cuts would begin to take effect by March 1, and Congressional leaders appear increasingly resigned to let the deadline pass without action. A broader deal is possible before a second deadline at the end of the month, when a budget deal is necessary to avoid a government shutdown. Any such deal could significantly reduce the economic impact of sequestration, which forecasters project will mostly fall in the second and third quarters. In normal times the Federal Reserve could offset the impact of spending cuts by reducing interest rates. But these are not normal times. The Fed already is engaged in a vast effort to stimulate the economy, using monetary policy to suppress interest rates. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned repeatedly that such policy has limited power to offset additional cuts. Some politicians are warning that agencies will need to take steps like furloughing air traffic controllers or shrinking early childhood programs. ''We are doing everything possible to limit the worst effects on D.O.D. personnel, but I regret that our flexibility within the law is extremely limited,'' said Leon E. Panetta, the defense secretary, in a letter to his staff on Wednesday. ''We have no legal authority to exempt civilian personnel funding from reductions. As a result, should sequestration occur and continue for a substantial period, D.O.D. will be forced to place the vast majority of its civilian work force on administrative furlough.'' While the cuts would take a modest toll on the overall economy, the pain would be concentrated in some areas, like the Washington suburbs that are home to many federal workers and government contractors. ''Sequestration would feel like a cold to most of the nation, but to Prince George's County and the rest of the Washington metropolitan area, it would feel like a bad case of pneumonia,'' Rushern L. Baker III, the executive of Prince George's County in Maryland, said on Tuesday in a statement issued with the leaders of neighboring counties.DETROIT -- Automakers reported on Tuesday that March sales of new cars and trucks were the highest monthly total in five years, providing more evidence of a sustained turnaround in the industry. According to Autodata, 1.45 million vehicles were sold during the month, a 3.4 percent improvement over last year, as a strengthening housing market and low interest rates spurred consumers and businesses to replace aging models. It was the best monthly performance since 2007, executives and analysts said, and it reinforced their sales forecasts for the full year at more than 15 million vehicles. ''Even though consumer confidence has been up and down this year, there are 'wealth effects' that are making Americans feel comfortable finally buying new cars they've been waiting for,'' said Lacey Plache, an economist for the auto research site Edmunds.com. General Motors, the largest American automaker, said it sold 246,000 new vehicles during March, a 6.4 percent increase over the same period last year. While sales of its biggest brand, Chevrolet, were flat, G.M. said sales of its Cadillac brand increased almost 50 percent and Buick sales rose 37 percent. G.M. benefited from a steadily growing demand from the construction industry for new pickup trucks. Sales of the Chevrolet Silverado increased 8 percent, and the company expects even better results when it begins delivering a newer-model truck to showrooms over the next few months. ''Trucks have improved in lock step with the housing market,'' said Kurt McNeil, head of the company's sales operations in the United States. Ford Motor said it sold 236,000 new vehicles during the month, a 5.7 percent improvement over a year earlier and the company's best monthly performance since May 2007. The results were driven by the heart of the Ford lineup. Sales of the midsize Fusion sedan topped 30,000 for the first time, and demand for the Escape sport utility vehicle was up more than 27 percent. Ford also posted a 16 percent gain in sales for its F-series pickup, the best-selling vehicle in America. ''Full-size pickup demand continues to gain momentum, outperforming the industry for the third consecutive month,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's marketing and sales chief for the United States. Chrysler sold more than 171,000 vehicles in March. Its 5 percent improvement over a year ago was smaller than in some recent months, and it underscored the company's need to keep refreshing its showrooms with new models. The company said sales of its Ram pickup truck increased 25 percent over the previous year, and the new Dodge Dart compact car had its best month since it was introduced last summer. Chrysler is revamping its cornerstone Jeep brand with a new version of the Cherokee S.U.V. and other models. Analysts said broadening the Jeep lineup was crucial to Chrysler's chances of returning to the double-digit monthly growth it had in 2012. ''Chrysler's March sales story is one of old and new,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Edmunds.com. ''Jeep desperately needs the Cherokee to get back into positive territory.'' The Japanese automakers all reported sales increases in March. Toyota said it sold 205,000 vehicles in the month, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. While the company more than doubled the sales of its redesigned Avalon sedan, its top-selling Camry declined 11 percent. Nissan sold 137,000 vehicles, a 1 percent improvement over last year. The all-electric Nissan Leaf, which is now produced at the company's Tennessee assembly plant, had its best monthly sales of 2,200 vehicles. Honda posted the strongest results of the Japanese companies, selling 136,000 vehicles for a year-over-year gain of 7.1 percent. Much of the improvement was caused by a 26 percent increase in sales by its Acura brand. Both Toyota and Honda are back at full strength from lingering inventory problems caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and they are aggressively updating their showrooms with new products. All the automakers are advertising heavily to bolster spring sales. One of the busiest has been Volkswagen, which is rapidly expanding its American operations. Volkswagen sold 37,000 vehicles in the month, a 3.1 percent increase from a year ago. The company said that was its best March since 1973, when it was among the few import brands available in the United States. Adding in the company's Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini brands, it sold 51,226, a 5.8 percent increase.DETROIT -- Automakers said new vehicle sales in the United States rose sharply in January, indicating that the industry's steady recovery is not slowing despite weak job growth and an uncertain economy. A total of 1.04 million cars and trucks were sold during the month, a 14 percent increase from January 2012, according to the research firm the Autodata Corporation. Analysts said the strong demand surpassed their expectations. They cited improved sales of pickup trucks as a sign that construction contractors and other businesses were optimistic about the economy. ''Sales were at the high end of the forecast,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst at the auto research site TrueCar.com. ''The main reason was the truck segment outperformed for the most part.'' In 2012, the industry turned in its best performance in five years, with sales of 14.5 million vehicles -- a 13 percent increase over 2011. Auto executives and analysts are forecasting sales this year as high as 15.5 million vehicles. They attribute the positive outlook in part to consumers' need to replace aging vehicles, a factor that has driven strong industry sales since last year, and in part to improvements in housing starts. While Toyota had the best month among the major automakers, all of the Detroit car companies reported solid gains. General Motors, the largest of the Detroit manufacturers, said it sold 194,700 cars and trucks in January, a 16 percent increase from a year ago. All four of the company's domestic brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick -- had double-digit increases for the month, it said. G.M. has also rebounded from tepid sales of its core pickup trucks in recent months. It said sales of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup increased 32 percent from January 2012, and sales of the GMC Sierra improved 35 percent. ''The year is off to a very good start for General Motors,'' said Kurt McNeil, head of G.M.'s United States sales operations. ''There's a sense of optimism among our dealers that only comes when you pair a growing economy with great new products.'' Ford Motor, the second-biggest American automaker, said its sales in January rose 22 percent, to 166,500 vehicles. The company's passenger cars did particularly well, with an increase for the month of 34 percent. Sales of the recently redesigned Ford Fusion midsize sedan, which had been hampered by safety recalls, rose 64.5 percent. ''Much hand-wringing has taken place over early recalls of the Ford Escape and Ford Fusion,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. ''But that doesn't appear to matter to consumers, who bought those models in big numbers.'' Executives at Ford said the company expected consumer demand to grow consistently in 2013. ''The biggest driver of the year is going to be replacement,'' said Kenneth M. Czubay, Ford's United States sales and marketing chief. Chrysler, the smallest Detroit car company, said it sold 117,700 vehicles in January. That was a 16 percent increase from the same month in 2012, and it extended Chrysler's year-over-year sales gains to 34 consecutive months. The company said sales of its cars rose about 50 percent, while sales of its sport utility vehicles and trucks increased 3 percent. Its new small car, the Dodge Dart, had its best performance since being introduced in June. Toyota, the biggest Japanese automaker, said its sales in January grew 26.6 percent, to 157,700 vehicles. Its bellwether car models generated much of the increase, with a 32.4 percent gain for the Corolla compact sedan and a 36.5 percent rise in sales of the Prius line of gas-electric hybrids. Toyota also expects to gain market share with edgy redesigns of previously lackluster models like the Avalon sedan, which had a 50.4 percent increase in sales in January. The other two large Japanese auto companies, Honda and Nissan, lagged the overall industry gains. Honda said it sold 93,600 vehicles, an increase of 12.8 percent from a year earlier. Nissan struggled even more to keep pace, reporting a 2 percent increase in sales, to 80,900. Sales also cooled for the German automaker Volkswagen, which was one of the industry's best performers in 2012. Last year, combined sales of the company's Volkswagen and Audi brands grew more than 30 percent in the United States. In January, however, it reported that sales increased just 7.1 percent. ''The disappointment in the month was probably Volkswagen,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''It's probably not a major worry, as long as these numbers aren't sustained for several months.''To the Editor: ''As Crop Prices Surge, Investment Firms and Farmers Vie for Land'' (Business Day, March 19) doesn't address the fundamental differences between the farm crisis of the 1980s and the current farm boom. Today's interest rates are at an all-time low compared with the extremely high rates of the '80s. Land prices are high, but farmers are mostly using cash, not leveraged credit, to buy land. Only a small percentage of land is actually changing hands, part of the supply-and-demand reason land prices have climbed. Many farmers in the '80s had second and third mortgages because of operating losses' being refinanced. Those types of loans are not part of agriculture lending today. If land prices fall, some farmers won't feel so good about their last land purchase, but the valuation drop won't put them out of business. If commodity prices fall, there will be short-term cash flow pain, but not the kind of business-ending and bank-closing pain we saw in the crisis years. The two big differences between the '80s and now relate to total debt and leverage. Borrowing is down in the agriculture sector as farmers use more of their own money to finance operations. For a generation of agricultural bankers who have grown up with their customers and lived through the farm crisis years, we know that there are challenges ahead and that our industry is ready. JEFF PLAGGE Arnolds Park, Iowa, March 20, 2013 The writer is chairman-elect of the American Bankers Association.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index ended lower on Monday as worries over demand for Apple products drove down its shares and investors braced for earnings disappointments. Running counter to that was Dell's stock, which rose 13 percent to about a five-month high at $12.29 after Bloomberg News reported that the No. 3 personal computer maker was in talks with private equity firms to go private. Dell's gains offset some weakness in the technology sector. Apple lost 3.6 percent to $501.75 and was the biggest weight on both the S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after reports emerged that the company had cut orders for LCD screens and other parts for the iPhone 5 this quarter because of weak demand. The stock hit a session low of $498.51, the first dip below $500 since Feb. 16. ''With Apple, it seems as if the sentiment has shifted from this being the one stock that everybody wanted to own'' to people starting to see it as a company whose business is ''slowing down somewhat,'' said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management in Chicago. Adding to investor unease, fourth-quarter earnings kick into high gear this week. Analyst estimates for the quarter have fallen sharply since October. S.& P. 500 earnings growth is now seen up just 1.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 18.89 points, or 0.14 percent, at 13,507.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.37 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,470.68. The Nasdaq composite index was down 8.13 points, or 0.26 percent, at 3,117.50. Apple suppliers also lost ground, with Cirrus Logic off 9.4 percent at $28.62 and Qualcomm down 1 percent at $64.24. The Dow fared better than the other two indexes, helped in part by Hewlett-Packard shares, which rose 4.9 percent to $16.95. The stock, up early in the session after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the shares and raised its price target to $21 from $15, added to gains after the Dell report. Tech has ''become the arena for private equity or other capital-restructuring type of maneuvers because of the way their valuations and their balance sheets are,'' Mr. Kuby said. An appliance and electronics retailer, Hhgregg, slumped 5.7 percent to $7.44 after the company cut its same-store sales forecast for the full year. Earnings reports are due this week from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Intel and General Electric, among other companies. Third-quarter reports ended with a gain of just 0.1 percent, the worst for an S.& P. 500 profit period in three years, according to Thomson Reuters data. President Obama warned Congress at a news conference on Monday that a refusal to raise the nation's debt ceiling next month could mean a government shutdown and set off economic chaos. S.& P. futures had little reaction to comments after the bell by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who urged lawmakers to lift the country's borrowing limit to avoid a debt default. Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 98, and the yield fell to 1.85 percent, from 1.87 percent late Friday.PARIS -- Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, said Wednesday that it was abandoning its 2013 profit forecast in the face of a dismal European market. The company, which is based in Stuttgart and also makes buses and trucks, said it expected demand in Western Europe to continue hovering ''around a 20-year low'' this year. ''The German market,'' it added, ''cannot detach itself from this development and is expected to fall significantly short of the previous year's level.'' The carmaker said it still expected group revenue to rise this year. But even operating from the assumption that the second half of the year would be better than the first, it said it no longer believed it would be able to match its 2012 operating profit of about &#x20ac;8.1 billion, or $10.5 billion. Despite poor sales in Europe, Ford Motor said Wednesday that its net profit climbed 15 percent in the first quarter, to $1.6 billion, as record results in North America compensated for losses in Europe and South America. The company reported a pretax loss of $462 million in Europe, about triple the $149 million it lost in the region in the first quarter of 2012. Ford has said it expected a loss of up to $2 billion this year in Europe, where weak economic conditions have driven new vehicle sales to their lowest level in decades. The company is closing a major assembly plant in Belgium and accelerating other cost cuts in Europe. It said the ''outlook for the business environment in Europe remains uncertain.'' Results in Asia, where Ford is investing heavily in new factories and products, improved slightly. The company said it had a pretax profit of $6 million in the region compared with a $95 million loss a year earlier. Car sales in the European Union totaled just under three million units in the January-March period, down 9.8 percent from the period a year earlier. Last week, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association described that as the worst start to a year since it began collecting the data in 1990. In Germany, sales fell 17.1 percent last month, and the luxury segment, which long escaped the worst of the downturn, is now shrinking as well. In another worrying sign, recent data have shown the German economy, the largest in Europe, losing steam, meaning things may get worse. European automakers may also find themselves competing at a disadvantage against Toyota, Nissan and Honda, after the Bank of Japan began a campaign to end deflation that has driven down the yen and made vehicles built in Japan relatively less expensive in other markets. Daimler said its quarterly net profit slid 60 percent from a year earlier, to &#x20ac;564 million. Its earnings before interest and taxes, a measure favored by analysts, fell 56 percent, to &#x20ac;917 million, lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters survey of analysts. Revenue fell 3 percent, to &#x20ac;26.1 billion. Daimler had warned this month that it was reassessing its forecasts, raising expectations that its rivals might follow suit. But that caution was not mirrored at Volkswagen, the largest European automaker, which said Wednesday that it planned to meet expectations, holding operating profit steady in 2013. Despite the difficult market, ''we remain confident overall that we can pick up speed over the rest of the year,'' Martin Winterkorn, the VW chairman, said in a statement. Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, reports its first-quarter results on Monday. In Paris, PSA Peugeot Citroën said its first-quarter auto sales fell 10.3 percent, outpacing the European market decline. The French company does not report profit or loss on a quarterly basis. Peugeot, the second-largest European automaker, relies heavily on the Continent for its sales. It said Wednesday that its efforts to expand in China had paid off well in the first quarter, as its unit sales there increased 31 percent. Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit.IN a speech in Phoenix last Tuesday, President Obama finally entered the debate over the future of United States housing policy. But his talking points offered few details about how to reduce the government's giant footprint in the mortgage market. Mr. Obama vowed to keep mortgage costs affordable for first-time home buyers and working families, pleasing those who think that the government should have a large role in this arena. His call for investment in rental housing was a welcome change from past mantras that focused solely on increasing homeownership across the country. Playing to taxpayers who are angered by the government's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, Mr. Obama said he wanted to wind these companies down. That's an important goal. But as if to prove how hard this will be, both companies later in the week announced enormous profits for the second quarter of this year, most of which go to the government in the form of dividends. Together, the companies reported $15 billion in profits; with Treasury on the receiving end of this lush income stream, it will be tempting to keep the mortgage finance giants in business. Yet with the government backing or financing nine out of 10 residential mortgages today, it is crucial to lure back private capital, with no government guarantees, to the home loan market. Mr. Obama contended that ''private lending should be the backbone'' of the market, but he provided no specifics on how to make that happen. This is a huge, complex problem. In fact, there are many reasons for the reluctance of banks and private investors to fund residential mortgages without government backing. For starters, banks have grown accustomed to earning fees for making mortgages that they sell to Fannie and Freddie. Generating fee income while placing the long-term credit or interest rate risk on the government's balance sheet is a win-win for the banks. A coming shift by the Federal Reserve in its quantitative easing program may also be curbing banks' appetite for mortgage loans they keep on their own books. These institutions are hesitant to make 30-year, fixed-rate loans before the Fed shifts its stance and rates climb. For a bank, the value of such loans falls when rates rise. This process has already begun -- rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.4 percent last week, up from 3.35 percent in early May. This is painful for banks that actually hold older, lower-rate mortgages. Private investors, like mutual funds and pension managers, aren't hurrying back to the residential mortgage market, either. Deep flaws remain in the mortgage securitization machine, and it needs to be retooled before investors will begin buying these securities again. Perhaps the largest problem for investors who might otherwise be willing to return to the mortgage market is the lack of transparency in privately issued securities. Investors interested in mortgage instruments are not allowed to analyze the loans going into these pools before they buy them. The banks putting together the deals typically provide some data, like borrowers' incomes and credit scores, as well as whether the loans backed primary residences or second homes. But investors don't get access to actual loan files that can tell them what they need to know about the quality and types of the mortgages packed inside the deals. A CIVIL case filed by the Justice Department last week against Bank of America highlights the downside of nondisclosure. In that matter, prosecutors accused the bank of misleading investors when it sold them a mortgage security in early 2008. Although the bank contended in marketing materials that the security contained prime loans that met its underwriting standards, more than 40 percent of those loans did not comply with those standards, prosecutors said. Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, said the bank was fighting the case. ''These were prime mortgages sold to sophisticated investors who had ample access to the underlying data and we will demonstrate that,'' he said in a statement last week. But the Justice Department contends that the bank failed to disclose important facts to investors about the quality of the mortgages in the $850 million pool, which wound up performing badly. As of June 2013, prosecutors said, 15.4 percent of those mortgages had defaulted, indicating that they were of a far lower quality than advertised. The Justice Department estimates that investors will lose more than $100 million on the deal. Then there's another issue. Investors are also unlikely to take an interest in mortgage securities because serious conflicts of interest are still embedded in the process. For example, in the aftermath of the crisis, investors learned that they could not rely on the trustee banks charged with overseeing these loan pools to do their jobs. The trustees are supposed to make sure that firms administering the loans treat investors fairly. These duties include taking in and distributing payments as well as foreclosing on borrowers. Even though the trustees are supposed to work for investors, these watchdogs are actually hired by the big banks that not only package the mortgage securities but also provide administrative services for them. So it was perhaps not surprising that the trustees failed to make the big banks buy back loans that didn't meet the quality standards set out when the securities were originally sold. Such buybacks could have prevented billions in losses for investors, and the trustees' inaction indicated where their allegiances lay. Yet another reason for investors around the country to steer clear of mortgage securities is the recent action by Richmond, Calif., to seize underwater home loans and reduce the amount of debt outstanding on the properties. Many of the loans that the city officials want to restructure are held by mutual funds and pensions. Pimco and BlackRock, two huge mortgage investors, are among those represented in a lawsuit filed last week against Richmond, contending that such a plan would violate the contracts that investors agreed to when they purchased the loans. And the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of Fannie and Freddie, has concluded that Richmond's action could threaten the safety and soundness of the companies' operations, harming taxpayers. Mr. Obama's views on the path forward for housing finance are welcome. But much work needs to be done before private capital will come back to this market. Eliminating conflicts of interest and increasing transparency in the securitization process will go a long way to achieving that end.To the Editor: Re ''China's Military Is Accused by U.S. in Cyberattacks'' (front page, May 7): When China tries to steal corporations' technology secrets, companies turn to the United States government for protection. Yet Microsoft, Google, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and many others avoid paying American taxes by keeping hundreds of billions sheltered in ''offshore'' no-tax havens, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Ironically, the billions they avoid paying could support our country's cybersecurity, among so many other services and subsidies on which big business depends. Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney, called some of this sheltering ''outright tax fraud.'' The rest might be legal, but it's a slap in the face. Maybe cyberbullied businesses should ask their offshore hosts to respond. Imagine the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Bahrain getting tough with Red Army intelligence! Seriously, loyalty isn't just a word for others. Furthermore, ''American'' corporations that offshore profits shouldn't count on our being suckers forever. FRED REDMOND Intl. Vice President (Human Affairs) United Steelworkers Pittsburgh, May 9, 2013AT age 79, many people who can afford to do so are done working. Not Robert A. G. Monks. He is still hard at work, trying to change corporate America. A Boston Brahmin who has been a corporate lawyer, venture capitalist, energy company executive, corporate director and Reagan administration official, Mr. Monks has an elite background that might have made him a consummate corporate insider. Instead, in his latest book, ''Citizens DisUnited: Passive Investors, Drone C.E.O.'s and the Corporate Capture of the American Dream,'' he has issued what he describes as ''a call to arms.'' Mr. Monks has been battling for decades to make corporations more transparent and more democratic. Toward that end, he has founded companies like Institutional Shareholder Services, the Corporate Library and GMI Ratings, which assess the ways companies are governed. He has lobbied institutional investors to influence the behavior of companies in which they invest. He has also met with presidents, most recently President Obama at a reception in Boston where he tried to enlist support for his cause, without much effect so far. Now he is pleading for the direct involvement of millions of individual corporate shareholders. ''Nothing is going to happen unless you involve yourself,'' he said. ''Democracy isn't going to work without involved citizens and corporations won't work without involved owners.'' A slender 6-foot-6, Mr. Monks is imposing but not intimidating, with a courtly manner that seems at odds with the combative language he uses to describe corporate America. Big companies have captured the political system in the United States, he says, and chief executives have captured the corporations, ensuring that the nation is effectively run by a handful of top business managers who pursue their own narrow self-interest. ''The most powerful C.E.O.'s have effectively seized authority over a vast range of America's corporate resources,'' he wrote, ''and through those resources over the nation itself without assuming any responsibilities of dominion.'' For Mr. Monks, corporate governance centers on several main issues, including executive pay, corporate compatibility with the public interest and management's responsiveness to shareholders. He admires people like Ralph V. Whitworth, a founder of the private investment group Relational Investors, who, he says ''has set a model for constructive shareholder activism.'' Mr. Whitworth's approach has been to accumulate a stake in a public company, perhaps only 1 percent, and then fight his way onto the board, where he pushes for a change in corporate strategy. In 1999, Mr. Whitworth became acting chairman of Waste Management, helping it recover from an accounting scandal. A Hewlett-Packard shareholder, he joined its board in 2011 and became interim chairman earlier this year, amid a turnaround effort at the company. Although ownership in the stock market today appears more widely dispersed than ever, individuals have been exerting less control over companies, Mr. Monks said. For instance, many millions of Americans hold stocks through mutual funds, representing by far the largest ownership block among institutional investors. As a purely legal matter, mutual funds have significant power to influence all aspects of corporate governance. In practice, though, the funds have tended to be hands-off, passive investors. Mr. Monks thinks that needs to change. ''It's critical that mutual fund investors require the trustees of their accounts to act like stewards of each company they hold in their portfolio,'' he said. ''Many mutual fund companies are equipped to do this.'' Those that aren't should be responsive when researchers point out current problems. ''When a corporate governance issue comes to light,'' he said, ''they need to be involved.'' HE also contends that others among the nation's biggest investors -- charitable funds and endowments -- need to play more active roles. In his book, he argued that if excessive executive pay was to be curbed, it was important that the trustees of the top dozen endowments and charitable funds, accounting for $200 billion in collective assets, actively take a stand. ''These are flesh-and-blood individuals who can actually do something,'' he said. Mr. Monks comes from a patrician New England background. With his wife, Millicent -- a great-granddaughter of Thomas Carnegie, the younger brother of Andrew Carnegie -- he lives on a private island off the coast of Maine, from which he wages his battles against today's corporate titans. A self-described education snob, highly attuned to the background and credentials of those he meets, he earned a bachelor's degree at Harvard, did graduate work at Cambridge in Britain and then returned to Harvard for his law degree. He sees himself as one of the last of the Rockefeller Republicans, and he served as a co-chairman of Republicans for Obama in Maine during the 2008 presidential election. During that campaign, he entertained Barack Obama at his home. Mr. Monks even had political ambitions of his own. In 1972, 1976 and 1996, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate. During his first race, he said, he had an epiphany that eventually set him on the path of corporate governance reform. While staying at a hotel on the bank of the Penobscot River, he says, he saw a wall of white foam coming down the river. He learned that it came from the paper companies in the area. After that election, he became chairman of a trust company with paper company holdings. Mr. Monks said he wrote letters urging these companies to improve their environmental practices. The Clean Water Act of 1972 and its various amendments eventually provided the impetus for a significant cleanup of the river. In some ways, corporations have become more powerful and shareholders have become less involved, he said, yet he is not discouraged. ''I've had so little tangible success and yet I've never been happier,'' he said. ''Each one of us needs to ask what we can contribute. I've tried to expose the illusion of corporate democracy. It's a cost to all of us.''IT seems, these days, that we can barely keep pace with the tales of the famous and near famous who climb to great heights, plummet to great depths and then try to work their way back into the public's affection. Since the beginning of this year alone, we've had Lance Armstrong's sort-of apology interview with Oprah Winfrey acknowledging his use of a variety of performance-enhancing drugs, the efforts by the fashion designer John Galliano to put an anti-Semitic tirade behind him and the seemingly ill-fated, public (and lucrative) mea culpa by the best-selling author Jonah Lehrer for plagiarism and fabrication. Even as I was writing this column, news broke about another fallen celebrity: Oscar Pistorius, the South African double-amputee Olympic runner, was charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend. These never-ending stories may not affect our lives -- except, perhaps, to make us more cynical when the mighty fall. But they do raise questions about forgiveness and atonement that are important outside the world of the celebrity. ''Stories of trust violations abound in the media and business press,'' Kurt T. Dirks, a professor of managerial leadership at Washington University in St. Louis, and colleagues wrote in a recent journal article. ''However, these high-profile incidents are vastly outnumbered by the many trust violations that occur in the offices and hallways and other arenas of virtually all work organizations.'' And with our friends, partners, children, parents and, of course, the companies we do business with. I've written quite a bit about the need for our society to be more open to mistakes and failure. But what happens after that? Is forgiveness automatic? And how difficult is it -- or should it be -- to get redemption after a serious misstep? First, what is forgiveness? Jeffrie Murphy, a professor of law, philosophy and religious studies at Arizona State University, who has written about the issue for years, says it is ''a change of heart toward someone -- overcoming the feelings of anger and resentment that typically come from being wronged by another.'' But it is important to differentiate between forgiveness and trusting someone again, Professor Dirks said. So you may be willing to forgive a business that messed up a deal but nevertheless decide not to work with that business again. Or forgive an abusive partner, but never be in a relationship with that person again. Or even forgive those who committed a crime against you, but still believe they should be punished. ''The question is how much you've been personally harmed and what's at stake for you in the future,'' he said. ''It depends, also, if we have something to gain by interacting'' with the person or business again. Of course, it is often easier to avoid interacting with a person who has harmed you than a business, because often no good alternatives are available. But we can feel that we have some control by refusing to buy from a company that has sold us a lemon or provided terrible service. And, on occasion, enough consumers have pulled together to force a company to back down, as they did in 2011, when Bank of America bowed to customer pressure and dropped plans to impose a $5 monthly fee on debit cards. Research has also shown that we seem to be more willing to forgive -- and trust again -- those who make errors of competence rather than of character, Professor Dirks said. ''We believe issues of competence are changeable over time, but not issues of character or integrity,'' he said. ''And the truth is that probably you can change certain skills, but the underlying value system is probably harder to change.'' It has become somewhat common wisdom to believe that forgiving a person who did you wrong is not just the right thing to do, but will make you emotionally, and even physically, healthier in the long run by alleviating the anger and stress you feel. But Professor Murphy warned against assuming that forgiveness was always the right answer and that someone who failed to offer forgiveness was ''not a good person or a mentally healthy person.'' ''It's a good thing and a blessed thing to forgive, but I am skeptical of any universal sentiment,'' he said. ''Some people may be liberated by forgiving. Some may be liberated by getting even. Saying that people should automatically be forgiven doesn't do justice to different moralities and different psychologies.'' For example, he said, when he was a professor in Minnesota, he used to offer a colleague a ride to work during the harsh winters. The colleague then questioned his professional integrity in an unrelated matter, and refused to apologize. ''Did I forgive him?'' he said. ''No. I got pleasure seeing him wait for the bus in the freezing cold while I drove by in my nice warm car.'' And, some experts say, forgiving an offense too quickly or too readily may just paper over the offense and leave it to fester. What about our curious relationship with celebrities who have fallen? Why do we feel betrayed by people we don't really know? And are we more forgiving of them than of the people in our own lives? Jeremy D. Holden, who wrote about political, cultural and commercial movements in a book called ''Second That Emotion'' (Prometheus Books, 2012), said he believed that we develop a ''social contract'' with famous people that is based not on logic, but rather on the mistaken belief that we actually understand them because we hear and read about them so much. ''We feel we know these people intimately,'' he said. ''And they don't ask anything of us -- they just give us pleasure.'' We also imbue celebrities with traits they don't necessarily have, often because that's the image they're trying to sell and that we're very willing to buy. As the blogger Deborah Dunham wrote, in a post about her feelings of anger and disappointment toward Lance Armstrong: ''We wanted to think that someone could be the idol, the comeback champion, the survivor, the dad, the do-gooder and the boyfriend of a sexy rock star all wrapped up into one fit, strong body. Because if it was possible for one guy to have it all in such a big way, well, maybe, just maybe, we could have a slice of our own American dream.'' But the question of whether we should forgive Lance Armstrong or any of the celebrities who have let us down is irrelevant, Professor Murphy said. ''How have these celebrities wronged me? You have to be a victim in order to be wronged,'' he said. ''We have a fantasy image of them and we feel let down by them. That's more our fault than theirs.'' One thing that is true -- famous people, whether athletes or actors, are more likely to be able to overcome serious setbacks than the average Joe. Eve Tahmincioglu, a spokeswoman for the Families and Work Institute, noted, for instance, that most workers would be fired if they admitted to having sex with a subordinate. But David Letterman wasn't. And Kobe Bryant, who was accused of sexual assault by a hotel worker, said they had consensual sex but still made a public apology and continues to play with the Lakers. Even Mike Tyson, convicted of rape, seems to be on the comeback trail -- working with the director Spike Lee last year on a one-man Broadway play and doing the talk show circuit. But a noncelebrity would have a hard time simply getting hired with a criminal record or even a bad credit score, Ms. Tahmincioglu said. One could argue that few of us have the talents that these superstars possess and that we need to separate their skills from their personalities. Maybe. But it is also the case, as Ms. Tahmincioglu said, that when you are on the bottom and mess up, ''you are doubly in trouble.'' Perhaps one reason that we give the famous a pass, she said, is that we wish someone would give us a pass sometimes. E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.comTo the Editor: In a Feb. 11 column, ''The Conscience of a Corporation,'' Bill Keller wrote about business lawsuits against Obamacare's mandate that companies cover birth control, including abortion pills, in their insurance plans. He questioned the idea that corporations have a conscience. A corporation is simply a group of people acting together. The Supreme Court has ruled many times that corporations can exercise religion. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, protects ''any'' exercise of religion. That protection applies when families earn a living in business. There is no ''right'' to force religious people to pay for other people's abortions, contraception and sexual choices. The abortion pill mandate coerces religious employers, but those employers aren't asking to coerce anyone. All Americans, not just churches, are guaranteed freedom of religion in their daily lives. It is a terrible idea to expunge religion and ethics from business on the theory that businesses can care only about profit. MATT BOWMAN Washington, Feb. 13, 2013 The writer, senior legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, is lead counsel for several plaintiffs that have obtained injunctions against the mandate. To the Editor: It's a bit frightening to consider the broader implications of Bill Keller's column. If the Supreme Court finds favor with David Green's argument -- that as an evangelical Christian he shouldn't have to provide coverage for contraceptives to his employees -- we're all in deep trouble. What would stop a chief executive who follows Christian Science from refusing all medical insurance coverage for any employee, as it contradicts his basic religious principles? What would prevent a C.E.O. who belongs to the Church of Scientology, which has demonized professional mental health care, from refusing coverage for all mental health care? This road is better not taken, as this is just the short list. PAUL EPSTEIN Fitchburg, Mass., Feb. 11, 2013 The writer is a psychiatrist.BERLIN -- Otto Beisheim, who revolutionized retailing in postwar Germany by introducing the concept of selling wholesale goods directly to customers and the builder of the country's largest retailer, Metro, was found dead on Monday at his home in Bavaria. He was 89. Mr. Beisheim, who had been suffering from an incurable illness, committed suicide, his foundation, the Otto-Beisheim Group, said. Mr. Beisheim, who was said to have amassed a fortune of $3.3 billion, was intensely private and rarely in the public eye. Even at his company's shareholders' meetings, he was reported to have shown up on occasion masquerading under the name Müller. Mr. Beisheim founded Metro in 1964 and continued to hold a 10 percent stake. It is now the third-largest retailer in Europe, behind Carrefour of France and Tesco of Britain. Like Sam's Clubs and Costco in the United States, Metro stores sell only to members. But Metro members are mostly businesses or professionals. The son of a caretaker, Mr. Beisheim was born on Jan 3, 1924, near Essen, Germany. His family was too poor to pay for him to attend high school, so he became a leather tradesman. As a wealthy man, he later donated widely to schools and universities. The best known of these, a business school near Koblenz, carries his name: the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management. During World War II Mr. Beisheim was a radio controller in the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the Nazi Party. His military service became known publicly only in 2006, and some said a wish to hide his past may have contributed to his desire for privacy. After the war, Mr. Beisheim worked as an electronics wholesaler. While traveling in the United States he observed how goods were sold from warehouses to customers for cash. The idea differed from the German practice of placing orders on credit and having goods delivered to retailers or other institutional buyers. Returning to Germany, he founded Metro, the country's first cash-and-carry retailer, in 1964 at Mülheim an der Ruhr, in West Germany's industrial heartland. He later joined with the Haniel and Schmidt-Ruthenbeck families and expanded the company into Austria and France. It later moved into Denmark and Italy as well. The Metro Group, which today includes the Metro cash-and-carry stores, the electronics stores Saturn and Media Markt, Real hypermarkets and the Kaufhof line of department stores across Europe and Asia, was formed through a merger of several companies in 1996. One of Mr. Beisheim's main accomplishments at Metro was the purchase in 2006 of 85 Walmart stores by the group's Real division. Walmart had decided to withdraw from Germany after losing billions of dollars over a decade; the stores now operate under the name Real. Mr. Beisheim's wife of nearly 50 years, Inge, died in 1999. They had no children. He is leaving his fortune to two foundations that carry his name, one in Munich and the other in Baar, Switzerland.LOS ANGELES -- Fandango, the fast-growing online seller of movie tickets, has swallowed a rival company that runs Hollywood Movie Money, a popular gift-certificate system that studios use to promote DVD and Blu-ray releases. Fandango's acquisition of the company, Quantum Loyalty Solutions, catapults the online ticket seller deep into a backwater of the movie business, but a lucrative backwater nonetheless, said Paul Yanover, Fandango's president. ''It's a great accelerator for us,'' he said. Studios pay Quantum a fee to handle the distribution and redemption of promotional (usually, free) tickets to movies, which are often used to bolster sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs. One recent offer: Buy ''Monsters Inc.'' on Blu-ray and get free tickets to ''Monsters University.'' Fandango, which makes money by charging a processing fee for online ticket sales and by selling advertising on its Web site, has long worked to build a voucher business and has made some inroads. But Quantum has been a strong competitor, relying on longstanding relationships with studios and theater owners to resist Fandango's push into its territory. Quantum has a theater network that includes 36,897 screens. Fandango, which is part of NBC Universal, handles ticketing for about 21,000 screens.SAN FRANCISCO -- Decades ago, Dell gained fame as a maker of affordable, customizable computers. But it missed the industrywide shift toward smartphones and tablets. The company's financial earnings report on Thursday reflected that mistake. Dell reported net income of $204 million for its fiscal second quarter, down 72 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Revenue was $14.5 billion, about flat from the same period a year ago, but better than the $14.18 billion that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain costs, charges and other items, Dell's net income was 25 cents a share, a penny better than expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. ''In a challenging environment, we remain committed to our strategy and our customers, and we're encouraged by increasing customer interest in our end-to-end solutions offerings and continued growth in our Enterprise Solutions, Services and Software businesses,'' Brian Gladden, Dell's chief financial officer, said in a statement. Dell's shrinking income mirrors slowing sales of personal computers at a time when many people are buying tablets instead. To keep its momentum going, Dell cut prices for many of its products but sacrificed profit margins. The company's revenue for its end-user computing business, which includes personal computers, accessories and third-party software, was $9.1 billion, down 5 percent from the year-earlier period. Shipments of PCs were down slightly from last year. For the second quarter, Dell shipped about 8.98 million PCs, compared with 9.35 million in the year-earlier period, according to Gartner, the research firm. Dell remains the No. 3 PC seller with about 12 percent of the market, trailing Lenovo, which has 16.7 percent and Hewlett-Packard, with 16.3 percent. IDC, another research firm, noted that Dell's shipments over the quarter improved in the United States, where it climbed above 3.8 million units for the first time since 2011. However, sales struggled in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, IDC said. The one area that showed strong growth for Dell was enterprise computing, which brought in revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8 percent from the quarter a year ago. Revenue grew from sales of networking hardware and server equipment. Dell is not the only company that is watching computer sales evaporate. Sales of personal computers worldwide dropped to 76 million in the second quarter, a 10.9 percent decrease from the year-earlier quarter, according to Gartner. Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst, said low-cost tablets were eating into the sales of low-end PCs in mature markets. In economically disadvantaged markets, a cheaper tablet is the first computing device many people buy, she added. ''While Windows 8 has been blamed by some as the reason for the PC market's decline,'' Ms. Kitigawa said, ''we believe this is unfounded.'' She said Windows 8 did not explain why the decline had been happening for several quarters, nor did it address why sales of Apple's personal computers, which run exclusive Mac software instead of Windows, were shrinking as well. Dell reported earnings against the backdrop of a proposal from its founder, Michael Dell, to take the company private. His plan is to refocus the company on cloud computing by selling crucial components like networking hardware, servers, storage and software, without the pressure of Wall Street. Mr. Dell's offer has run into opposition, namely from Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire activist investor who says the founder is trying to buy the company for less than it is worth. Mr. Icahn recently sued the board over its decision to accept a higher buyout offer from Mr. Dell in exchange for changing the rules for voting on the deal. The company's shareholders are scheduled to vote on Mr. Dell's bid of $24.4 billion, or $13.65 a share, on Sept. 12.As told to Elizabeth Olson.  I WAS born in Pretoria, South Africa. My father was a chiropractor, and my mother operated a massage therapy college where students came to learn reflexology, massage techniques and natural health therapy. I'm the youngest of three boys, and I have a younger sister. By age 12, I was teaching ballroom dancing at my aunt's dance studio. Jazz was my favorite music. When I was 17, I began my first business, which distributed homeopathic medications, and spent a fair amount of time on the road visiting communities to sell them. I almost got expelled from school because I was attending so few classes. But I did graduate, thanks to the good graces of the principal. In June 1998, I traveled to San Jose, Calif., to play for South Africa's national team competing in the underwater hockey world championships. In underwater hockey, players wear a mask, fins and a snorkel, and dive to the bottom of the pool and compete to pass the puck. I became interested in the sport, which is fast-moving and great fun, because my brother Peter also played. I liked California so much that I decided to move to the United States to start a technology business. Together with my older brother Russell, who had been working in Silicon Valley, we started a company called Everdream that provided software for companies to maintain their computers remotely. At first, the two of us ran the company from our rented house in Santa Cruz, Calif., and the next year, in 1999, we secured our first funding. Soon after that, our brother Peter, a software engineer, joined the business. Eventually, we realized that our stand-alone business model was not feasible for the long term. In 2007, the company was acquired by one of our corporate partners, Dell Inc. Even before the sale, we had been working on an idea for a solar business. Our cousin, Elon Musk (our mothers are twins), who founded PayPal, suggested that we investigate clean energy. We started SolarCity on July 4, 2006, to symbolize our commitment to becoming independent of fossil fuels. Elon, who is the chief executive of SpaceX (the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation), and of the all-electric car company Tesla Motors, is chairman of SolarCity. We decided to build on our expertise in providing remote services and to focus on distributing solar energy. We install solar panels free, then sell the energy they generate to customers, often at a lower rate than they pay their utility providers. We have more than $1.7 billion in backing from investors including banks and companies like Honda North America and Google. We have grown to more than 2,800 employees in 14 states. Last December, SolarCity began trading publicly. We also provide solar services to large companies, including eBay, Walgreen and Wal-Mart Stores, to more than 300 schools and universities and to more than two dozen home builders. We recently helped a school district in the Central Valley of California convert to solar power, and save enough on its energy bills to be able to resuscitate its music program. But we still have a long way to go, because solar energy supplies less than 1 percent of America's energy needs. Tax incentives, just as they have for most energy sources of the past century, have helped make solar energy affordable and attract investors needed to expand operations. My other job is being the father to two young boys, 4 and 5. Their mother is my wife, Madeleine, who was my high school sweetheart. In my spare time, I still love to play underwater hockey, but my mission is to change the way people get their electricity and provide more affordable clean energy.E-book sales are no longer growing at a nerve-rattling pace. The unpleasant and expensive price-fixing lawsuit last year, pitting the Justice Department against five major publishers, has been settled. Independent booksellers added 65 stores to their ranks in 2012, according to their trade association, despite competition from Amazon. After a turbulent few years in the book business, there was a feeling at BookExpo America, the publishing industry's annual trade convention that convened in New York this week, that the disruption might have calmed. ''I'm hearing this gigantic sigh of relief everywhere I go in B.E.A. this year,'' Michael Pietsch, the newly installed chief executive of Hachette Book Group, said in a panel discussion. ''We're still here. People are no longer quite as anxious that the world is turning upside down.'' The event, which ends on Saturday, drew a crowd of 20,000 publishers, authors, agents, bookstore owners and librarians to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The trade show had barely opened on Wednesday when publishing executives who had trekked there began to roll their eyes at the center's familiar annoyances. ''Good old Javits,'' Reagan Arthur, the publisher of Little, Brown, wrote on Twitter. ''Horrible sight lines, minimal Internet access and $4 Diet Cokes.'' But gentle mocking gave way to the usual enthusiasm that permeates the convention, an event whose original purpose was partly to give bookstores the chance to order books for the fall season. It has evolved into something equally old-fashioned: a huge gathering for the book industry to talk up titles, showcase high-profile authors and try to build elusive buzz for promising books. This year, the lineup of celebrity authors included Chelsea Handler, there to promote ''Uganda Be Kidding Me,'' a travelogue; Helen Fielding, whose third Bridget Jones novel, ''Mad About the Boy,'' is scheduled for release in the fall; and Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' who has written a new novel, ''The Signature of All Things,'' her first in 13 years. On the sprawling exhibit floor, publishers big and small rubbed elbows. Near Random House's mammoth booth, the comparatively tiny Omnific Publishing promoted its titles with the slogan ''Romance ... Without Rules.'' Shadow Mountain, a Utah-based publishing company, advertised ''The Romney Family Table,'' by Ann Romney, a collection of stories and recipes offering ''a peek inside Romney family life and the food that has become an essential part of those memories.'' HarperCollins, pumping up one of its new authors, sponsored a gargantuan hanging billboard advertising a book by Mitch Albom that will be released in the fall. In the autograph area on Friday, fans lined up to meet Rick Riordan, Cassandra Clare and Walter Dean Myers. ''When you work in a library, you constantly hear that print is dying, and then you come here and feel so much energy,'' said Barbara Moralis, a librarian at Northampton Community College in Bethlehem, Pa., as she waited in a long line to meet the author Andrew Gross. ''Publishing is not dead.'' There were, in fact, several signs of health in an industry that has been buffeted by change in recent years. Oren Teicher, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said unit sales for independents increased nearly 8 percent in 2012. E-book sales, while still growing rapidly in the industry as a whole, have plateaued for some publishers. This provides more stability than the run-amok sales of previous years and gives publishers more clarity about consumers' book-buying habits. BookStats, a survey of the industry released last month, revealed that e-books now account for 20 percent of publishers' revenues, up from 15 percent in 2011. ''It seems like the growth rate of e-books has slowed,'' said Carolyn Reidy, the chief executive of Simon & Schuster. While there was the usual tut-tutting about Amazon -- Becky Anderson, a co-owner of Anderson's Bookshops, outside Chicago, referred to it as ''the company that shall not be named'' -- there was also no booth on the exhibit floor from the New York-based unit of Amazon Publishing, which caused much fear and consternation in the industry when it was founded two years ago. In a panel titled ''Publishing, Bookselling and the Whole Damn Thing,'' John Sargent, the chief executive of Macmillan, called Attorney General Eric Holder ''incompetent,'' a comment on the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishing companies filed last year. Apple, the only remaining defendant, will go on trial in federal court next week. But Mr. Sargent said the industry seemed to have stabilized. ''I was much more pessimistic a year and a half ago than I was now,'' he said. The organizers have invited members of the public on Saturday, for the second year in a row, to a ''Power Readers'' program that is intended to help build word of mouth for books beyond the industry. This year the organizers of the event were expecting 2,000 outsiders, a significant increase over 2012, when 500 attended. Authors, speaking to throngs of starry-eyed booksellers, did their best to rev up the crowds. At a breakfast attended by 1,000 on Thursday, Wally Lamb, the author of the forthcoming novel ''We Are Water,'' finished his remarks with a paean to booksellers. ''Writers and readers are two poles, apart from each other,'' he said. ''And you, ladies and gentlemen, are the electricity that connects us.''  The Japanese electronics maker Panasonic returned to the black last quarter as cost cuts and a weaker yen offset sliding sales. Panasonic is among the Japanese electronics makers battered by price plunges in gadgets and hot competition from more successful rivals Apple in the United States and Samsung Electronics of South Korea. Panasonic reported a 61.4 billion yen ($667 million) profit for the October-December period Friday. It had a loss of 197.6 billion yen ($2.1 billion) a year earlier. Quarterly sales slipped 8 percent to 1.8 trillion yen ($19.6 billion). The company said global demand weakened for flat-panel TVs and digital products and devices, but sales grew in LED lighting and auto-related equipment.CAMPAIGNS for Web sites that offer lodging reservations usually feature colorful characters, perhaps to counter the prosaic, transactional nature of e-commerce. Among them are the Roaming Gnome, for Travelocity; the Negotiator, played by William Shatner, for Priceline; hordes of animated travelers, for Hotels.com; and a man in a crash helmet delivering Price Assurance checks, for Orbitz. A competitive Web site is taking a decidedly different tack as it begins its first image campaign, as part of efforts to raise its brand's profile among American travelers. The campaign, which is to start on Tuesday, promotes Booking.com, a unit of the Priceline Group that operates separately from Priceline. The Booking.com campaign, with an initial budget estimated at more than $35 million, will include commercials on television and in movie theaters as well as ads online. The campaign is being created by the Amsterdam office of Wieden & Kennedy, which was chosen after an unpublicized review that also included agencies based in cities like New York and San Francisco. The Priceline Group classifies Booking.com, founded in 1996, as one of its international brands, along with Agoda.com and Rentalcars.com. Booking.com, based in Amsterdam, has been offering accommodations at American hotels, motels and resorts for the last six years, said Paul J. Hennessy, chief marketing officer at Booking.com. ''It's time for our coming-out party,'' Mr. Hennessy said in an interview on Friday in Midtown Manhattan as he offered a preview of the campaign. ''The U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we see great potential there.'' It is also one of the most competitive travel markets, Mr. Hennessy acknowledged. But, he said, he believes there is an opening for Booking.com because the lodging Web sites that are familiar to Americans have ''commoditized the market'' by ''all pounding the same message of low-price guarantees and best prices.'' ''American customers are ready for a new hero, if you will,'' Mr. Hennessy said, ''and Booking.com could be that hero.'' To underline that, the campaign will celebrate what Mark Bernath, the executive creative director at Wieden & Kennedy Amsterdam who joined Mr. Hennessy for the interview, called ''the delight of right'' -- that is, the potential moment of truth when a traveler who booked a room online ''opens the door and has a first look'' and is pleased or relieved, rather than dismayed or disgusted, by what he or she finds inside. ''The pressure on the booker can be quite intense,'' Mr. Bernath said, ''so anyone who puts the best tools into your hands'' to produce a positive outcome will be perceived ''as a good partner to have.'' That is perhaps more relevant in the United States than in Europe, said Mr. Bernath, an American who has worked at Wieden & Kennedy Amsterdam since 2007. ''The plight of the American traveler,'' Mr. Bernath said, is that the number of days of vacation ''is less than in Europe.'' As a result, ''it's more crucial, if you have two weeks instead of four or five, to nail it,'' he added, when booking accommodations. That is brought to life in the 60-second commercial that will serve to introduce the campaign. The spot takes a tongue-in-cheek approach, presenting a family of five on vacation in the dramatic way that NFL Films covers a Super Bowl. ''This vacation has been a year in the planning,'' a stentorian narrator says as the family walks, in slow motion, down a hotel hallway, and ''hinges on'' the reaction to the room. ''The door opens,'' the narrator says. ''You hold your breath. And then you realize, you got it right. You got it Booking right.'' The narrator encourages travelers to ''bask in the Booking glory'' and concludes: ''Booking.com. Booking.yeah''; he pronounces the latter ''Booking-dot-yeah.'' The phrase ''Booking.yeah'' appears on screen along with the theme of the campaign, ''Planet earth's No. 1 accommodation site.'' Using the brand name as an adjective and rendering it as ''Booking.yeah'' is an example of a marketing tactic known as nameonics, which ties a brand name to a product quality or benefit. Other examples include ''Zestfully clean,'' for Zest soap; ''Krogering,'' for the Kroger supermarket chain; and, in a campaign created last summer by Wieden & Kennedy Amsterdam, ''Power through,'' for Powerade sports beverages. ''In a lot of advertising in the category, there are beautiful places, beautiful people,'' Mr. Hennessy said, ''or just giving you a number,'' referring to the price of the room being booked, ''but no connection to the brand.'' By contrast, the brand is an intrinsic part of the Booking.com campaign, he added. Other, shorter commercials will make similar points. One spot, which shows two gleeful women bumping chests, declares, ''Behold the power of a well-booked accommodation.'' In another spot, which asserts that ''when you get it right,'' ''you'll never want to leave,'' a man is depicted having to drag a woman from their room to get her to check out. And a spot about using Booking.com on mobile devices promises that the Web site means ''the odds are in your favor,'' in a moment that seems to mash up ''The Hunger Games'' and ''National Lampoon's Vacation.'' The media buying for the campaign is being handled by the New York office of Wieden & Kennedy. As the campaign runs in the United States, Mr. Hennessy said, executives at Booking.com will ''see how it resonates and see how customers react to it.'' Based on that reaction, the ads could be expanded into markets like Europe, he added, where Booking.com is far better known.  The Federal Reserve says it expects to collect $440 million in fees from 70 big banks and other financial firms to help cover its costs of supervising them. The Fed provided the estimate in announcing it had completed a rule providing for the annual fees. The fees are intended to help defray the costs of expanded regulation, which the Fed gained under the 2010 financial overhaul law. The payments for 2012 are due by Dec. 15, the Fed says. They apply to the largest banks with operations in the United States and nonbank financial firms that have been deemed as potentially threatening the stability of the financial system. Regulators last month classified the American International Group and GE Capital as falling into that category.LE BOURGET, France -- As the business part of the Paris Air Show drew to a close Thursday -- Friday is when the gates open to the public -- Boeing and Airbus were totaling up orders here that were worth more than $135 billion between them. It was two and a half times the total orders the two companies collected at last year's show, in Britain. Analysts attributed the higher dollar figures mainly to airlines' renewed interest in the next generation of bigger, and more expensive, wide-body jets. Driving that trend are expectations for improvement in the global economy, along with carriers' need to replace aging fleets of fuel-guzzling long-distance jets. But analysts also cautioned that coming years are unlikely to see a similar boom in jet purchases. One reason is that a frenetic buying spree over the past three years has left Airbus and Boeing with burgeoning order books -- and ever-longer waiting times for airlines to receive their new planes. Most of the airlines and leasing companies that ordered new Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 jets at the Paris Air Show this week said they did not expect to begin receiving them for four to five years. The volume of orders ''has to come down, partly because of the constraint of supply,'' said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners in London. ''If you want to have an A350 or 787, you are going to wait a long time.'' Another constraint, he said, is that airlines do not want to see too many of those big jets, with their hundreds of seats, competing with one another. ''If you have too much capacity going in too quickly, it drives down fares,'' Mr. Cunningham said. Airbus announced signed orders and purchase commitments at the Paris show for 466 planes valued at $69 billion at list prices. Boeing said its tally of 442 planes was worth more than $66 billion. Precise figures are hard to come by because airline customers rarely pay full list price for jets and large orders typically come at steep discounts. At last year's global aerospace bazaar, held in Farnborough, England, Airbus and Boeing together had $54 billion in new jet orders and commitments. Most of those deals were for the Airbus A320neo, a version of the popular A320 single-aisle plane with more fuel-efficient engines, and Boeing's competing single-aisle plane, the 737 Max, which also uses the next generation of engines. Both manufacturers secured several hundred orders for single-aisle planes again this year. But it was in the wide-body segment that the intensifying competition was on full display at Le Bourget airport, near Paris. Boeing announced dozens of new orders for its 787 Dreamliner, despite a three-month grounding this year because of problems with its lightweight but volatile lithium-ion batteries. Those deals included commitments for more than 100 stretched versions of the plane that Boeing said it would start delivering in 2018. Airbus, meanwhile, made the most of the momentum it gained last week for its rival A350 after its inaugural flight; it is due to enter service in late 2014. The European plane maker managed to secure 69 new orders for the A350 this week, bringing its total backlog to 362. The A350 made its second test flight this week from the company's headquarters in Toulouse, about a 90-minute flight south of the French capital. Fabrice Brégier, the Airbus chief executive, confirmed that a third flight would pass over Le Bourget on Friday, when the exhibition opens to the public. At that point, the air show, which ends Sunday, will be mainly an opportunity for people to ogle airplanes on the ground and in flyover exhibitions.  Chevron reported on Friday that its net income fell 4.5 percent in the first quarter, pushed lower by falling oil prices and a decline in refinery output. Chevron, the second-largest United States oil company after Exxon Mobil, has delivered better profit margins than the other energy majors in recent years because a big part of its production mix is oil, which has been costly. But crude oil prices fell across the globe in the first three months of this year as Europe remained stuck in recession and growth in China slowed. That reduced Chevron's revenue and profit. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., said on Friday that its net income fell to $6.2 billion, or $3.18 a share, on revenue of $56.8 billion. Last year in the same quarter the company earned $6.47 billion, or $3.27 a share, on revenue of $60.7 billion.  Bank of America on Friday won a federal judge's approval for a $2.43 billion settlement with investors who said the lender hid crucial information when it bought Merrill Lynch. The accord, among the largest investor settlements stemming from the recent global financial crisis, was approved by Federal District Judge P. Kevin Castel in Manhattan. Judge Castel called the settlement ''fair, reasonable and adequate.'' Shareholders said Merrill's mounting losses and bonus plans should have been disclosed before investors voted on the merger in December 2008. Bank of America denied the plaintiffs' claims, but the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has said the settlement would remove uncertainty for bank.  The Ford Motor Company said on Friday that it planned to hire 2,200 salaried workers in the United States this year, its largest increase in new salaried workers in more than a decade, to support new Ford product introductions. The hiring is in addition to the more than 8,100 combined hourly and salaried jobs Ford created in the United States in 2012, as the company increased production capacity and expanded engineering, manufacturing and other areas to meet the growing demand for its vehicles, the company said. About 1,000 of the positions are hourly jobs brought back to Ford plants in the United States from other locations, including Japan and Mexico. Ford said it was more than halfway to the 12,000 new jobs it committed to deliver in the United States by 2015 as part of its 2011 contract with the United Automobile Workers. ''As we expand our product lineup of fuel-efficient vehicles, we need more people in critical areas, such as in a range of engineering activities, vehicle production, computer software and other I.T. functions, to ensure we deliver the vehicles people want and value,'' Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford's president for the Americas, said in a news release.The stock market edged higher on Monday, although disappointing McDonald's earnings kept the Dow Jones industrial average from making any significant gains. Banks and health shares were the day's best performers; financial stocks advanced for the 10th time in the last 12 sessions. Bank of America led the group, while the American-listed shares of UBS rose 60 cents, or 3.22 percent, to $19.24, after the Swiss bank's second-quarter profit exceeded forecasts. Analysts said the market would probably trend higher in the absence of any weak economic news, but it would need strong earnings and positive forecasts to post large gains. ''Most earnings have been good, maybe not great but good, and as a consequence I think investors continue to show that equities is the asset class of choice for them right now,'' said Richard Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management. Weaker-than-expected results from the fast-food company McDonald's weighed on the Dow after it said its full-year results would be ''challenged'' by falling sales in Europe. McDonald's shares lost $2.69, or 2.68 percent, to $97.58. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.81 points, or 0.01 percent, to 15,545.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached another nominal closing record high, rising 3.44 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,695.53. The Nasdaq composite index added 12.77 points, or 0.36 percent, to 3,600.39. The S.& P. 500 has advanced nearly 19 percent so far this year. Nearly one-third of S.& P. 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including Apple on Tuesday. Of the 109 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported earnings for the quarter, 64.2 percent have exceeded analysts' expectations, while fewer than half have topped revenue estimates. In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 93 21/32, while its yield remained at 2.48 percent.The Apache Corporation agreed to sell its business in the Gulf of Mexico's shelf to a portfolio company owned by the private equity firm Riverstone Holdings for about $3.75 billion. The buyer, Riverstone's Fieldwood Energy, is buying a business with 239 millions of barrels of oil equivalent in reserves at the end of last year, more than half of which is oil and 75 percent of which is already developed. The deal is the biggest sale on record by Apache, which has spent $15 billion in acquisitions over the last three years alone, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. In a statement, the company said that the deal is meant to help rebalance its portfolio, though it will also offload about $1.5 billion worth of asset retirement obligations. Apache will retain a 50 percent stake in all exploration blocks in the assets, and it will work with the buyer, Fieldwood Energy, in developing deep-water sites in the holdings. ''At the end of this process, we expect Apache to have the right mix of assets to generate strong returns, drive more predictable production growth, and create shareholder value,'' G. Steven Farris, Apache's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The deal is one of the biggest takeovers associated with Riverstone alone, according to Capital IQ, although the firm has partnered with others on some of the biggest energy-related private equity firms in history. ''We have had a long-standing and strong relationship with Apache's executive management and have been great admirers of their entire organization and their Gulf of Mexico operations for many years,'' Pierre F. Lapeyre Jr. and David M. Leuschen, Riverstone's co-founders, said in a statement. Apache was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani. Fieldwood is receiving financing from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman. It received legal counsel from Vinson & Elkins and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at five-year highs on Friday as the market registered a third consecutive week of gains after a solid start to the quarterly corporate earnings season. Morgan Stanley was the latest Wall Street bank to report strong results. Its better-than-expected earnings came after similar report cards from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase earlier in the week. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 7.9 percent to $22.38. It reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank's institutional securities business. But the rise on Friday was held back by shares of the Intel Corporation, which slumped 6.3 percent to $21.25 a day after the company forecast quarterly revenue below analysts' estimates and announced plans for increased capital spending while demand is slow for personal computers. Another factor weighing on the market before a three-day weekend is uncertainty over the federal debt limit and spending cuts that could hamper the recovery. The markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday for Martin Luther King's Birthday. There were signs on Friday that the question of raising the debt limit would be put off for a while. House Republican leaders said they would seek to pass a three-month extension of federal borrowing authority next week to provide time to the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass a budget that shrinks deficits. ''It could be a big positive for the markets if we come up with a plan of spending cuts that isn't too awfully hard on the economy,'' said Bryant Evans, an investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Ill. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.68 points, or 0.39 percent, at 13,649.70. The S.& P. 500 was up 5.04 points, or 0.34 percent, at 1,485.98. The Nasdaq was down 1.30 points, or 0.04 percent, at 3,134.71. The Dow and the S.& P. ended at their highest levels since December 2007. For the week, the Dow ended up 1.2 percent, the S.& P. ended up 1 percent and the Nasdaq ended up 0.3 percent. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, fell 8.2 percent. Also reporting stronger-than-expected earnings on Friday was General Electric. Its shares rose 3.5 percent, to $22.04. Over all, the S.& P. 500 fourth-quarter earnings are forecast to have risen 2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That estimate is above the 1.9 percent forecast from a week ago but well below the 9.9 percent fourth-quarter earnings forecast from Oct. 1, the data showed. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 98 3/32, and the yield fell to 1.84 percent, from 1.88 percent late Thursday.DETROIT -- As this debt-ridden city lurches toward a possible bankruptcy filing, residents and workers have been locked in a grim faceoff with creditors over how to preserve what remains of their services and benefits. Contributing to the municipal anxiety is the possibility that some of the city's cultural treasures could be sold off, including masterpieces in the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Belle Isle park in the Detroit River. But there is another Detroit family jewel in question that is largely unknown outside the automobile world and to some people even more treasured -- a collection of 62 lovingly maintained classic cars donated to the city since the 1950s by civic-minded families seeking to preserve the Motor in Motor City. Most of the cars are stored under protective plastic bubbles in a World War II-era riverfront warehouse on the grounds of Fort Wayne, while others are on display at the Detroit Historical Museum or on loan to exhibits around the country. Just as art patrons are resisting selling van Goghs and Matisses to satisfy Detroit's debt, car lovers are pushing back at the possibility of losing what they regard as the city's historic industrial heart and soul -- including a Cadillac Osceola that dates to 1905, and a vintage Ford Mustang worth an estimated $2 million. ''The cars stand for us, the expression of the thousands of people working hard to produce the birthright of America,'' said Jerry Herron, a Detroit historian and dean of the Irvin D. Reid Honors College at Wayne State University. ''It would be a sad day for Detroit and for America.'' If Detroit winds up in bankruptcy court -- and no one knows if that will happen, or exactly what would follow -- city assets of all sorts could be placed on the block to satisfy creditors, who will look to recoup some of their money lost on the city's bonds and other long-term debt. In a Chapter 9 bankruptcy -- which is highly unusual, especially for a big city -- it would be up to a judge, if asked, to decide on a request to sell assets like the art or cars. Even if a judge is so inclined, some creditors might be loath to appear too hard-nosed by going after municipal treasures. ''They're going to want to take everything they can out of the city's assets, but they won't want to take the heart out of the body,'' said James V. McTevia, a corporate turnaround expert who runs McTevia & Associates in Bingham Farms, Mich. Last Friday, the city's emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, started negotiations with creditors, asking them to accept pennies on the dollar for the $15 billion to $17 billion they are owed. Short of bankruptcy, he says, he has no plans to sell off assets. ''Selling an asset creates a one-time revenue source, which has little lasting impact on sustaining city services for years to come,'' said Bill Nowling, a spokesman for Mr. Orr. Last week, Michigan's attorney general, Bill Schuette, wrote in an opinion that at least the artwork could not be sold. Bob Sadler, director of sales and marketing for the Detroit Historical Society, which manages the prized auto collection, said museum officials had yet to meet with Mr. Orr and his staff. From the perspective of Adam Lovell, the curator of the historical society's museum, the cars' real value lies in what they represent for Detroit. Each vehicle in the collection has a story that, taken together, ''tell little snippets, tiny microstories'' of Detroit's history. The stories feature industry titans making groundbreaking cars, and workers fighting to prove their grit to the world -- and to their companies. It is an eclectic collection, from the innovative 1934 Chrysler Airflow four-door sedan to the 1960 Chevrolet Corvair -- later declared by Ralph Nader to be ''unsafe at any speed.'' Even an AMC Pacer, one of the oddest cars from the 1970s, sits in the 50,000-square-foot warehouse, which smells like a musty basement and pulses with the whir of the fans that keep the bubbles inflated 24 hours a day. There is also the 1919 Dodge coupe belonging to John Francis Dodge, with gold initials JFD imprinted on the rear door and an odometer that reads 4,126. A 1902 Oldsmobile runabout is considered the first mass-produced automobile in the world. A 1987 Cadillac stretch limousine was custom-made by workers in a failing bid to persuade General Motors to keep open the Fleetwood plant where it was made. Mr. Lovell counts among his favorites a 1924 two-door Hupmobile with a four-cylinder engine, manufactured by the long-defunct Hupp Motor Car Company. ''If you look in a 1920s Detroit phone directory for car companies, you're going to see 60 different listings,'' he said. ''That just boggles people's minds. Some produced two cars, some produced hundreds.'' Another unlikely favorite of his is a 1984 Dodge Caravan. ''I call it the Model T of the '80s,'' he said. ''It defined the soccer mom generation.'' For Sandra Studebaker of Fraser, Mich., who donated the minivan to the historical society in 2004, the four-cylinder, standard-transmission vehicle has personal significance. ''It had become a member of my family,'' said Ms. Studebaker, a distant relative of the Studebaker automotive family. ''I even named it Brown Betty. I could not give Brown Betty to anyone who would run it into the ground.'' The collection is valued at more than $12 million, according to an independent estimate produced by Hagerty, the classic car insurer based in Traverse City, Mich., at the request of The New York Times. ''You can tell it's a collection meant to paint the history of the automobile,'' said Jonathan Klinger, a Hagerty spokesman. ''It's designed to tell a story.'' The collection started with the donation of the 1905 Cadillac Osceola by the family of Henry M. Leland, a general manager at Cadillac. The first enclosed-top Cadillac, it was built for Mr. Leland to drive in bad weather and contains a one-cylinder engine that could run on lighter fluid as well as on gasoline. While most of the vehicles were donated, several were purchased by the historical society, which lends them to other institutions, from the National Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio, to the Owls Head Transportation Museum in Maine. The vehicles are also rotated through the Detroit Historical Museum, which the historical society operates. The prospect of losing the collection would be hard to imagine, Mr. Lovell said. ''Priceless,'' he said, as he unzipped the dusty plastic cover over a 1963 Ford Cougar II concept car. ''Everything is priceless.''LAST week, I glimpsed the future. I tried on Google Glass, the much-anticipated computer eyewear that lets you skim e-mail and shoot video. After some awkward fiddling, I managed to make the device work for me. It was a dazzling taste of something I'd previously seen only in science-fiction movies. I marveled at many things, but mostly at the magical way the display -- a glowing, transparent cube -- floated over my field of vision, showing maps, photographs and simple messages. All too soon, my time was up. I handed the high-tech glasses back to a Google employee, with the sinking feeling that it could be a while before I'd be that close to them again. That's because they cost $1,500, and they are being made available largely to developers and people who are eager to figure out how to build applications for them. When they go on sale to the rest of us later this year, they'll probably be cheaper, Google says, but not by much. The company doesn't have plans for a partnership with a carrier that might be able to subsidize the cost of the hardware, and it evidently isn't seeking a mass market immediately. Of course, there are very real-world business concerns behind the pricing, noted Susan Etlinger, an analyst at the Altimeter Group. ''New technology is always expensive when it's introduced because of the research and development costs,'' Ms. Etlinger said. ''It's the same with drugs.'' My brief encounter with Glass doesn't prove anything about its chances of success. The gadget might not work effectively all the time, and it might fall flat on its face in the mainstream consumer market, as many have predicted. But in some significant ways, the product is pushing the boundaries of the way we think about omnipresent computing, Web search and the ownership of data and privacy. Surely, wearable computers are in our future, whether they are embedded in glasses or smart watches or even contact lenses. But the experience of wearing Glass raised questions for me about the future of new technology and who gains access to it first -- part of a much larger debate concerning the undercurrents of power and privilege that course through the Web. At the very least, the release of Glass could shape how we think about human and computer interactions, and -- considering Glass's abilities to quietly take photographs and record videos -- how we influence policies about privacy and public spaces. And it would be a shame if the only people who participate in this leap forward are those who can afford it. It's not just Glass that poses an inkling of a trend toward technology for the 1 percent, or at least for the relatively affluent. Facebook, for example, has been testing a feature that requires people to pay to send messages directly to people who are on Facebook but who have not agreed to be their ''friends.'' Then there is app.net, a Twitter-like service that promises a higher-quality stream of information and news, if you pay for it, with subscriptions starting at $5 a month. Some analysts say the future of security and privacy on the Web will belong to those who can afford expensive, anti-hacking software and other protective services. That could be the antithesis of the rise of the social Web, which promised a utopia imbued with the ability to empower those who used it, regardless of their location, financial means and level of privilege. ''We used to have a distinction between early adopters and people with the most disposable income,'' said Anil Dash, an entrepreneur and blogger who raised similar concerns last year in a post titled ''You Can't Start the Revolution From the Country Club.'' ''Ignoring the value of inclusiveness is tantamount to building a gated community,'' Mr. Dash wrote. ''Even with the promise that the less privileged might get a chance to show up later, you're making a fundamentally unfair system.'' He says we are at an interesting inflection point where the cost of computing has never been lower, and services like Facebook and Twitter give people a free and relatively frictionless way to connect with hundreds, even thousands, of others with the click of a button. Understandably, many companies are trying to cash in on these developments. But will it be at the cost of excluding most people from the best and safest technology? This isn't an entirely new phenomenon. When the iPhone came out, it cost almost $600, in its cheapest form, and I couldn't afford one. By the time I'd picked up enough extra shifts as a waitress to pay the price, the second and third versions of the gadget were on the market. There's no doubt that the device changed my life. It made me a much more streamlined individual and eventually gave me a competitive advantage as a budding technology reporter who had firsthand experience as the Apple ecosystem evolved. Relatively early access thus proved beneficial, as it has for many others who were the first to adopt and use new services, like the early ''vloggers'' (that's video bloggers) on YouTube or developers in the App Store. AT the moment, the new Google Glass is also out of my price range. But it stands to reason that this won't always be the case, says Bill Maris, managing partner at Google Ventures who is also involved with the Glass Collective, a venture fund devoted exclusively to financing the production of applications for the computer glasses. ''There's an evolution curve to new technology,'' he said. ''This isn't the endpoint.'' In other words, if Glass is good enough, and enough people want to buy it, the cost will come down significantly. It's just a matter of time. ''If it is not useful, it will go away. That is the market force,'' he said. ''The latency between introduction and general availability is shortening.'' He pointed to the way that most smartphones have dropped in price. But for the most part, the cheapest devices aren't the newest or fastest ones. And the implications of that -- that hand-me-down technology is a good-enough for poorer people -- are troubling in their own regard. David Lee, a managing partner at SV Angel, an angel investment firm, doubted that consumers would immediately embrace a shift as radical as wearing a computer in fancy eyewear. ''Unless you're a Steve Jobs, a change in user behavior comes from the ground up,'' he said. Wherever the next innovations come from, I hope they are reasonably priced. Otherwise, the future may start to look a little more like another science-fiction vision: a Brave New World.A decade ago, Apple transformed the music business with its iTunes store. Now what the music industry expects from Apple is less of a revolution than a helping hand. Apple's newest music feature, iTunes Radio, will be released on Sept. 18 as part of its iOS 7 system update, the company announced on Tuesday. The service is a sleek take on Internet radio, and Apple's ability to place the app on millions of its devices gives it an enormous potential audience from Day 1. ''It's a huge opportunity on a global basis to accelerate the transition of radio listeners and advertising dollars from terrestrial to digital,'' said Stephen Bryan, the executive vice president for digital strategy at the Warner Music Group, which releases music by Green Day, Bruno Mars and hundreds of other acts. The service is a threat to Pandora Media, which dominates Internet radio. But music and advertising executives say that the magnitude of that threat is unclear, given Apple's relatively late entry into streaming music and Pandora's strong market position. Both offer free streams of music tailored to a user's taste and supported by advertising. In August, Pandora had 72.1 million active users -- almost all in the United States -- who streamed 1.35 billion hours of music, according to data released by the company. ''At this point Pandora is one of the leading recipients of mobile advertising revenue, and is one of the most popular apps, period, across devices,'' said Clark Fredricksen, a vice president at eMarketer, a research firm. ''It's tough to see it getting killed.'' Instead, record labels and music publishers hope that Apple's immense marketing power will attract more advertisers and help popularize Internet radio around the world. ITunes Radio will at first be available only in the United States, but it is expected to be introduced internationally soon. Apple operates iTunes stores in 119 countries. ''It's hard to say that Pandora hasn't helped make Internet radio mainstream already,'' said Glenn Peoples, the senior editorial analyst at Billboard. ''But iTunes Radio can help it grow and can change the impressions of it in the minds of advertisers and sponsors.'' Apple is the single largest retailer of music, its downloads providing labels a crucial source of revenue as sales of CD's drop. One feature of iTunes Radio that music companies are particularly grateful for is a prominent button to buy a song as it streams. Subscribers to Apple's iTunes Match feature, for $24.99 a year, can have that song instantly linked through the cloud to all of their Apple devices. In the economy of digital music, one 99-cent download can be worth more than hundreds of streams. Apple's deals with labels call for it to pay 0.13 cents for every song streamed on iTunes Radio during its first year of operation, according to reports in Billboard and elsewhere based on Apple's licensing contracts. That is more than Pandora's current rate of 0.12 cents, and Apple will also pay music companies a portion of the service's advertising revenue. Apple is entering an already crowded Internet radio market, which besides Pandora includes Clear Channel Communications' iHeartRadio app; radio functions offered by on-demand services like Spotify; and others like Songza that supply ready-made playlists for various occasions, like working out or hosting a dinner party. This week Microsoft expanded its Xbox Music service, which includes a radiolike function, to work on Apple and Android devices. So far Pandora's investors have not fled. Since news of Apple's plans first emerged a year ago, Pandora's stock has roughly doubled. On Tuesday it closed at $20.35, up 1 percent for the day.The stock market rose on Monday as investors looked toward an earnings season expected to show modest growth despite concerns about the health of the economy. The major market indexes fluctuated between positive and negative territory for much of the day before climbing in the final hour of trading, ending near session highs. Volume was light, and the Dow Jones industrial average's gains were limited by a decline in shares of Johnson & Johnson. Forecasts for first-quarter earnings have been scaled back in 2013, with profits now seen rising just 1.6 percent from the quarter a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. In January, earnings for the quarter were expected to rise 4.3 percent. The drop in expectations has come as economic figures suggest the recovery could be less robust than some had thought. Weak corporate results could give investors more reasons to sell, pushing both the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index back from recent nominal closing highs. ''We're waiting for earnings for evidence that the market can be supported at these levels,'' said Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management. ''We will see growth in earnings, but clearing the expectations bar could be difficult, which could give us reason to pause.'' The season unofficially started after the market closed with results from Alcoa, the aluminum company. It reported earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue was down from the quarter a year ago. After initially rising in after-hours trading, Alcoa's stock slid 13 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $8.26. As the first Dow component to report, Alcoa is informally viewed as setting the initial tone for the season, though many more bellwether companies will not report results until next week. The Dow industrials rose 48.23 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 14,613.48. The S.& P. 500-stock index gained 9.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,563.07. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 18.39 points, or 0.57 percent, to 3,222.25. Stocks have rallied strongly this year. Major indexes have hit milestone highs, helped by the Federal Reserve's stimulus program. The S.& P. 500 is up 9.6 percent for the year, while the Dow has gained 11.5 percent. Despite that, major indexes posted their worst weekly loss for 2013 last week, with the payroll report fueling concerns about economic growth. ''A lot of the momentum we had in the first quarter was based on improving economic news, and the jobs report really took the wind out of our sails,'' said Mr. Dunigan, who helps oversee $116 billion in assets. ''We're still trying to sift through what that means for our prospects .'' Among the most active stocks on Monday, Advanced Micro Devices jumped 30 cents, or 13 percent, to $2.59, making it the S.& P. 500's biggest percentage gainer, after a report that Microsoft would use A.M.D. chips in its new Xbox game console. Monster Beverage rose $2.33, or 4.7 percent, to $52.01, helping to elevate the S.& P. consumer staples sector index, which rose 1.1 percent. On the downside, the health care company Johnson & Johnson fell 93 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $81.11 after JPMorgan Chase downgraded its stock to neutral from overweight, saying it faced ''a messy first quarter and a likely downward revision to 2013 guidance.'' Lufkin Industries, a maker of oil field pumps, jumped $24, or 37.6 percent, to $87.96 after General Electric said it would buy Lufkin for about $3.3 billion. G.E., a Dow component, rose 19 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $23.12. In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 102 10/32, while its yield rose to 1.75 percent, from 1.71 percent late Friday.  STOCK EXCHANGES are vulnerable to the same business realities as the companies whose securities they trade. Many an exchange that once served as a dense and buzzing hub of commerce no longer exists. Still others have been swallowed up by other entities. The venerable New York Stock Exchange, set to be bought by IntercontinentalExchange, is just one example. The Chicago Board of Trade, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and many others worldwide have been caught up in a 21st-century wave of consolidation. Beyond that, the idea of stock exchanges as physical entities where dealers jostle and shout -- not to mention litter the floor with tiny pieces of paper -- is fading as electronic exchanges become a more efficient, if less evocative, way to buy and sell securities.  FILONUK--William. Fordham University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA) community mourns the passing of William "Bill" Filonuk Jr., FCRH '77, GBA '83 on May 25, 2013 at the age of 58. Bill was tireless in his commitment to GBA. He recently served as first Vice Chair of the GBA Board of Overseers. He gave his time, knowledge, and expertise to numerous areas within GBA including career services, quantitative financial research, entrepreneurship, and positive marketing. He was a superb mentor to students, drawing upon his successes as a managing director at BNY Mellon. We will miss Bill's wisdom, optimism, generosity and selfless service to GBA. On behalf of the GBA community we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Susan, son David, and his entire family. Edward Stroz, Chair Board of Overseers David A. Gautschi, Ph.D., Dean Graduate School of Business Administration Fordham UniversitySEOUL -- LG Display reported Monday its smallest profit since it returned to profitability in the second quarter of last year, as demand for iPhone and iPad screens weakened amid concerns that Apple was losing its luster in the mobile device market. Apple, which business analysts say provides about 30 percent of LG Display's revenue, is facing intensifying competition from Samsung and other rivals. A disappointing forecast by a U.S. supplier to Apple last week heightened fears about slowing demand for Apple's devices, pushing the shares of Asian suppliers, including LG Display, sharply lower. LG Display, which vies with the panel unit of Samsung Electronics for the top position in LCD flat screens globally, made 151 billion won, or $135 million, in operating profit in its first quarter, which runs from January to March. That compared with the average forecast of a profit of 147 billion won in a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts. It was the company's fourth consecutive quarterly profit after seven consecutive quarters of losses, as makers of LCD panels have since curtailed output after about two years of oversupply. The result was also a sharp improvement over a loss of 211 billion won a year earlier. But it was down 74 percent from the previous quarter, hurt by a seasonal slowdown in demand and by weaker sales to Apple, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday. Sales of tablet and smartphone panels, which are largely bought by Apple, accounted for 27 percent of LG Display's total screen shipments in the first quarter, down from 31 percent in the fourth quarter. Jay Yo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, estimated before the results announcement that LG Display's panel shipments for the iPhone 5 and the latest iPad had fallen 42 percent and 66 percent, respectively, from the prior quarter, as Apple struggled with slowing sales growth. Apple is expected to report just an 8 percent increase in revenue for its fiscal second quarter, among the weakest showings in years, according to analysts' estimates. Still, analysts see earnings for LG Display improving in the coming quarters, as Apple is expected to introduce improved products later this year and as demand increases for mobile device screens from the display company's affiliate LG Electronics. Harrison Cho, Samsung Securities analyst, said he expected Apple to introduce a less costly iPhone around July, helping LG Display improve its sales to Apple starting in June when initial parts shipments are expected to begin. LG Display said Monday that it expected panel shipments to rise 5 percent to 10 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter. Shares in LG Display have fallen about 3 percent in the year to date, compared with a roughly 5 percent drop in the benchmark Kospi. The stock closed 2.2 percent higher before the results announcement.LOS ANGELES -- On a film set, even the bugs bite by the book. And the book is voluminous, 131 pages of guidelines imposed by the American Humane Association on film and television productions, all seeking those coveted words of approval: ''No animal was harmed.'' Still, animals sometimes are harmed, and when they are, the public outcry is swift. A year ago, after a third horse was injured and euthanized on the HBO series ''Luck'' -- the horse reared, flipped over backward and struck her head on the ground -- the company announced the next day that it was canceling the show. Incidents like those on ''Luck'' focus attention on the humane association and its ability to monitor and enforce standards. In the aftermath of those deaths, animal rights groups pressed for answers amid suggestions of negligence, and a former association employee filed a wrongful termination suit, saying she was punished for lodging complaints about the treatment of horses. More recently, there was a reaction over the deaths of some two dozen animals during production of the ''Hobbit'' films and a recent Kmart commercial on which a shark died. In a statement last Thursday, the humane association, which is based in Washington, said it was investigating the death last week of a dog that had been taken to a clinic at the association's behest after showing signs of distress before it was called to the set of a commercial shoot. Trainers and others in the business accuse the association of being too cozy with the industry, which provides its financing, and of being more interested in expanding its power than exercising it. The humane association argues that it is struggling to meet the challenges of protecting animals in an era of modern filmmaking. ''We're not covering enough animal action, because of the way the business model in the industry has changed,'' Robin R. Ganzert, the association's chief executive, said in a phone interview last month. Ms. Ganzert and others suggest that the association's resources and authority are too limited in an era that has brought the proliferation of smaller productions -- like indie films, cable TV and even Internet productions -- as well as a sharp rise in public expectations regarding animal safety. Many of these issues will get a hearing at a planned meeting on Wednesday at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences here. So far, however, studio response has been cautious. Queried about plans to attend, no major studio except Warner Brothers confirmed that it would attend. Film companies generally value the association's certification, which tends to allay public concern about animal scenes, and few would suggest that the current financial shortfalls are beyond the reach of an industry that churns through billions of dollars in revenue each year. But the studios have yet to address the problem, partly because executives are wary of meddling with a financing system devised to operate at arm's length. Still, word of the planned get-together is provoking a fierce reaction among animal trainers and others who have not been invited (though a trainer will join a panel discussion). Some suspect the association of a power-grab that is meant to increase income, and cover its own failings. Trainers, who are already heavily regulated by state and federal officials, are particularly incensed by the idea that the association might seek to extend its authority beyond film sets, to include certification of those who house and supply animals -- something they see as an attempt to bolster funds by tapping them for fees. ''It feels to us that they're becoming an animal rights organization no longer interested in what's right and wrong in the industry, but only in collecting money,'' said Benay Karp, an animal-keeper whose company is equipped to supply trained skunks, prairie dogs, hummingbirds or, if the scene calls for it, a rhinoceros. In January, Ms. Karp led an uprising in which about three dozen trainers and others confronted association officials at their Studio City office. The trainers complained that the group had failed to back them in disputes with aggressive producers and directors, has often dispatched monitors who had no specific experience with exotic animals on a set, and was getting too chummy with the industry it watches. They cited Hallmark Channel's ''2011 Hero Dog Awards,'' for which Ms. Ganzert was an executive producer. Some trainers said the association had crossed a line by supplying a dog that was not specifically trained for film. ''We turned it into a listening meeting,'' Karen Rosa, who oversees the association's film and television operation, said of the showdown. ''For some people, we'll always be too tough. For others, we'll never be tough enough.'' Regarding the dog awards, Ms. Ganzert said an executive of the association, without her knowledge, had indeed furnished the production with a personal pet. ''It should not have happened,'' Ms. Ganzert said in an e-mail, adding, ''It won't happen again.'' The group is entitled to place monitors on any union-covered shoot that uses animals -- and is empowered to shut down a production that hurts an animal. As such, monitors can sometimes be in conflict as they weigh the safety of the animals against the demands of a film production schedule. The group is supported by an annual grant from the Industry Advancement and Cooperative Fund, a nonprofit that receives a small contribution from the entertainment industry that is tied to actors' earnings, and is jointly overseen by producers and members of the now-merged S.A.G-Aftra actors' union. Officials of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, S.A.G.-Aftra, and the I.A.C.F. either declined to comment or did not respond to queries about the humane association grant. According to Ms. Ganzert, the film monitoring unit in its last fiscal year, which ended June 30, covered 3,498 shooting days, and issued certifications on 570 productions. That was up from 2,392 shooting days, and just 144 certifications, in the fiscal year that ended in June of 2003. While certifications nearly quadrupled in the period, said Ms. Ganzert, the industry's annual grant to the association rose only about $500,000, to about $2.1 million in the current fiscal year -- and it has actually fallen from a recent peak of roughly $2.5 million. At the same time, Ms. Ganzert, who joined the association in 2010 after working with the Pew Charitable Trusts, was imposing new fiscal discipline on the parent organization, which for years had engaged in a calculated program of deficit spending enabled by a bequest of more than $30 million in the last decade. As she cut expenses by nearly 30 percent, Ms. Ganzert reduced staff, including six monitors in the Hollywood unit. At the pending meeting, Ms. Ganzert said she instead expected to explain that many union-covered animal shoots were currently left unmonitored for lack of funds, and that about $5.8 million would be needed to oversee them all. (One person who has worked closely with the association, and spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict, estimated that 50 percent of the intense animal action in film is not being covered.) In late December, meanwhile, a longtime executive with the association's film unit, Barbara Casey, filed suit against the group and HBO, which produced ''Luck.'' The suit claims she was dismissed after the group succumbed to what Ms. Casey said was pressure from producers to ignore her complaints about the abuse of horses. Alan Zuckerman, a lawyer for the association, said in an interview that Ms. Casey had been let go as part of a necessary staff reduction. HBO has said that any claims that it did not treat horses well are ''entirely without merit.'' Still, Ms. Casey is described by a former colleague as having been a strong, and sorely missed, advocate for on-set monitors who do not always feel they have the organization's support in the inevitable face-offs with filmmakers. That has led to whistle-blower reports, some of them directed to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -- an activist organization that is officially opposed to the use of animals in entertainment, though it more pragmatically confines its strong objections to the use of wild breeds. The whistle-blowers, Ms. Ganzert said, were probably an inevitable by-product of her own organization's downsizing. ''We don't downplay problems,'' she said, ''we address them quite seriously.'' As for bugs, Tonya Obeso, an association monitor, spent one recent day at Universal Studios, making sure that some performing spiders were treated well on the set of ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.'' ''We had three black widow spiders, and five false widows,'' Ms. Obeso said. There were also some frozen pill bugs. But those were purchased dead, she said, to comply with the group's prohibition against putting animals that might eat each other in the same container.The shameful thing about Apple Inc.'s ability to structure its business to avoid United States taxes was not that it did it. In fact, as Apple executives tried to point out at the Senate hearing at which their tax strategies were detailed, they could have chosen to pay much less in American taxes than they did. The shameful thing is that we have a tax system that seems to allow multinational companies to choose what they want to pay. The fact that this costs the government money is important, but that is not the critical element. Revelations about the ability of the rich and well connected to duck taxes can have a corrosive effect on the attitudes of the rest of us. If others who are better off than you can get away with not paying taxes, why shouldn't you look for a way to cheat on your taxes? The news in the Senate report about Apple was not that the company had found ways to shift income to low-tax jurisdictions. Lots of multinational companies do that. The news was that Apple had found a way to move a large part of its income to subsidiaries that claimed to not exist anywhere, at least when it came to paying taxes. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, had good reason to call that the holy grail of tax avoidance. In that way, the Apple hearing filled a similar role to the one played by disclosures about Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney, during the last presidential campaign. It had been common knowledge that private equity firms had found ways to have most of the money earned by partners taxed at low capital gains tax rates, through what is known as carried interest. What came out last year was that some had found a way to treat all of their compensation that way. Senator Levin, and the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, John McCain, tried to make the point, again and again, about how unfair the current system is to domestic companies, which cannot hide profits overseas, and to ordinary taxpayers, whose income is derived from salaries and investments that are automatically reported to the Internal Revenue Service. ''The general American public should not have to make up the balance as corporations avoid paying billions in U.S. taxes,'' Senator McCain said. But no other Republican senator seemed interested in that analysis. They praised Apple for avoiding taxes, saying that benefited its shareholders. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a physician, suggested it would ''probably be malpractice'' for a chief financial officer not to do everything possible to minimize the corporate tax bill. If that is the standard, perhaps Senator Paul, instead of apologizing to Apple for the fact that the hearing was being held, should have joined in what he called the ''vilification'' of the company, but for an entirely different reason. As Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, testified, there is a whole range of tactics Apple has chosen not to use. ''Apple does not hold money on a Caribbean Island, does not have a bank account in the Cayman Islands, and does not move any taxable revenue from sales to U.S. customers to other jurisdictions in order to avoid U.S. taxation,'' he said. I asked Jeffrey M. Kadet, who spent a career with large accounting firms helping companies to minimize their international tax payments -- working in places like China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Russia -- and now teaches tax law at the University of Washington, to review the subcommittee's report on Apple. ''Apple's basic structure and planning described in the memorandum appears to be appropriate corporate tax planning in today's environment and is consistent with what I review with my students in class,'' he said in an e-mail. ''The company appears to be almost conservative in its approach of not trying to move any portion of profits on sales to U.S. customers into its overseas structure as some other groups have done.'' One such company, as the Senate subcommittee documented last year, is Apple's archrival, Microsoft. What Apple did was transfer rights to its intellectual property to a subsidiary that was incorporated in Ireland -- and therefore not subject to immediate United States taxation -- but managed in California. Under Irish law, that freed the subsidiary from Irish taxation. How is that ''almost conservative''? The Irish subsidiary has rights to the company's patents and trademarks in Asia, Africa and Europe, but not in North or South America. Apple kept those rights in its United States operation. It thus appears to pay more United States taxes than it could have. If you look at taxes as Senator McCain seems to do, one person finding a way around taxes means the rest of us have to pay more. After all, the government must raise enough money to meet its obligations. But that is not the way a lot of Republicans look at it now. They have denounced taxes for so long that some of them seem to view those who manage to legally avoid paying taxes as heroes. Some of them also seem to think that the government they help to run is evil and that depriving it of revenue is therefore a good thing. In theory, under the current law, American multinationals will pay American taxes on all profits -- less whatever foreign taxes they paid -- when they bring the profits home. That is known as ''deferred'' taxation. But they try to avoid doing that, and hope they can persuade the government to let them pay a minimal tax on such repatriated profits, rather than the full rate. Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive, endorsed that idea in his testimony. Asked what the rate should be, he replied, ''To incent a huge number of companies'' to bring back money, the new rate ''would have to be a single-digit number.'' In other words, he took for granted that paying American taxes was voluntary for multinationals. Everyone seems to agree that corporate income taxes need to be reformed and that a base rate well below the current 35 percent should be part of that. But beyond that, there is widespread disagreement. Multinational corporations have been campaigning for a ''territorial'' tax system, in which the United States would tax only profits generated in this country. Doing that without finding a way to close down the loopholes that allow companies to move taxes around would simply ratify the current situation, with the difference that companies would no longer face the possibility of paying American taxes when they brought the money home. And as the hearing made clear, at least to those who studied the documents, closing those loopholes may be impossible under the current system. Companies can have one subsidiary pay any price they want to another subsidiary, so long as it is reasonably close to what an arm's-length negotiation would produce. The I.R.S. is overmatched when it tries to challenge such pricing, particularly because there are often no comparable deals struck by companies that are not affiliates. It would be nice if the leading developed countries could agree to cooperate in the taxing of multinationals, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on a report with ideas for how that could be accomplished. Don't hold your breath. If that is not going to happen, the United States could simply end the deferral system and put in some kind of minimum tax based on global profits. If an American company paid less than, say, 15 percent, in total taxes, then it would owe the difference to Uncle Sam immediately, whether or not it brought the profits home. To get anything done, Congress will have to agree that Senator McCain's way of looking at taxes is correct, and accept that giving a tax break to one person or company must mean forcing others to pay more than they otherwise would.N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President George W. Bush.  THIS summer, the Obama administration released the President's Climate Action Plan. It is a grab bag of regulations and policy initiatives aimed at reducing the nation's carbon emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. This got me to thinking: What might I do to reduce my own carbon emissions? Here are some things I came up with. Think of them as Greg Mankiw's Climate Action Plan. I could buy a smaller, more fuel-efficient car. I could swap my traditional car for one with new technology, like a hybrid or an electric vehicle. I could car-pool to work. I could use public transportation. I could move closer to my job. I could buy a smaller house that requires less energy to heat and cool. I could adjust the thermostat to keep my home cooler in winter and warmer in summer. I could put solar panels on my roof. I could buy more energy-efficient home appliances. I could eat more locally produced foods, which need less fuel to transport. I could go on, but by now you get the idea. Every day, we all make lifestyle choices that affect how much carbon is emitted. These decisions are personal but have global impact. Economists call the effects of our personal decisions on others ''externalities.'' The main question is how we, as a society, ensure that we all make the right decisions, taking into account both the personal impact of our actions and the externalities. There are three approaches. One approach is to appeal to individuals' sense of social responsibility. This is what President Jimmy Carter did during the energy crisis of the 1970s. He encouraged Americans to adjust their thermostats and insulate their homes. I can still picture Mr. Carter sitting in the chilly White House, wearing his cardigan sweater. It's true that as a socially responsible economist, I always weigh the global costs and global benefits before pushing the ignition button on my car. (Yes, my tongue is firmly planted in my cheek.) But expecting most people to act this way is unrealistic. Life is busy, everyone has his or her own priorities, and even knowing the global impact of one's own actions is a daunting task. THE second approach is to use government regulation to change the decisions that people make. An example is the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards that regulate the emissions of cars sold. The President's Climate Action Plan is filled with small regulatory changes aimed at making Americans live more carbon-efficient lives. Yet this regulatory approach is fraught with problems. One is that it creates an inevitable tension between the products that consumers want to buy and the products that companies are allowed to sell. Robert A. Lutz, the former General Motors executive, laments that CAFE standards are ''a huge bureaucratic nightmare.'' He says, ''CAFE is like trying to cure obesity by requiring clothing manufacturers to make smaller sizes.'' Yet another problem with such regulations is that they can influence only a small number of crucial decisions. In a free society, the government can't easily regulate how close I live to work, whether I car-pool with my neighbor or how often I don a cardigan. Yet if we are to reduce carbon emissions at minimum cost, we need a policy that encompasses all possible margins of adjustment. Fortunately, a policy broader in scope is possible, which brings us to the third approach to dealing with climate externalities: putting a price on carbon emissions. If the government charged a fee for each emission of carbon, that fee would be built into the prices of products and lifestyles. When making everyday decisions, people would naturally look at the prices they face and, in effect, take into account the global impact of their choices. In economics jargon, a price on carbon would induce people to ''internalize the externality.'' A bill introduced this year by Representatives Henry A. Waxman and Earl Blumenauer and Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Brian Schatz does exactly that. Their proposed carbon fee -- or carbon tax, if you prefer -- is more effective and less invasive than the regulatory approach that the federal government has traditionally pursued. The four sponsors are all Democrats, which raises the question of whether such legislation could ever make its way through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The crucial point is what is done with the revenue raised by the carbon fee. If it's used to finance larger government, Republicans would have every reason to balk. But if the Democratic sponsors conceded to using the new revenue to reduce personal and corporate income tax rates, a bipartisan compromise is possible to imagine. Among economists, the issue is largely a no-brainer. In December 2011, the IGM Forum asked a panel of 41 prominent economists about this statement: ''A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as 'corporate average fuel economy' requirements for automobiles.'' Ninety percent of the panelists agreed. Could such an overwhelming consensus of economists be wrong? Well, actually, yes. But in this case, I am confident that the economics profession has it right. The hard part is persuading the public and the politicians.WHAT good is a policy if it's never enforced? That's a question investors are asking these days about an executive pay standard that companies rarely seem to use. We're talking about so-called clawback provisions allowing a company to retrieve compensation paid to executives who were later found to have grievously mismanaged or misbehaved. Clawback policies have been in investors' sights since the mid-2000s, after the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom. Shareholders began agitating for programs to retrieve pay if a company restated its earnings or uncovered embezzlement, bribery or other malfeasance. These shareholder proposals paralleled a measure under the Sarbanes-Oxley law that enabled regulators to go after executive pay that was later shown to have been generated by bookkeeping improprieties. But in the almost 10 years since clawback policies became a hot topic among investors, there is little indication that they have resulted in significant recoveries. High-profile cases occasionally emerge -- Ina Drew, the former head of JPMorgan Chase's chief investment office, returned some pay after the disastrous losses she oversaw in the London whale matter. But examples like these are few and far between. So some investors are taking up the issue again. Among them are officials overseeing the LongView Large Cap 500 index fund. LongView, which is run by the union-owned Amalgamated Bank, was among the first shareholders to push for clawback policies. In 2004, it submitted a proposal at Computer Associates when that company was embroiled in an accounting mess. This year, LongView has joined other investors to push for more stringent policies among health care companies. The investors chose this industry after a series of federal investigations turned up evidence of illegal drug marketing; the companies involved in those matters wound up paying large settlements. Still, there were no indications that individual executives were made to return pay as a result. ''As investors we have to rely on the board to represent our interests and take action,'' said Scott Zdrazil, director of corporate governance at Amalgamated Bank. ''We want to make sure that compensation committees can exercise their discretion where appropriate without having to rely on outside regulatory agencies to get involved.'' The McKesson Corporation, a giant medical and health care concern, is one company that LongView has targeted. Last week, at its annual meeting in San Francisco, a majority of shares -- 53 percent -- voted in support of its proposal intended to toughen up its policy. The vote is not binding on the company, of course. In a statement on Friday, Kris Fortner, a McKesson spokesman, said: ''We appreciate the support shown by our shareholders and the thoughtful way many have engaged with us as they carefully considered the proposals presented. This year's proxy vote provided another opportunity for us to hear from shareholders and we are committed to responding to their feedback while remaining focused on delivering significant long-term value for our investors.'' Under McKesson's current policy, the board can go after senior executives' pay under three circumstances. First, it can move to claw back money if an employee engages in ''intentional misconduct pertaining to a financial reporting requirement'' that causes the company's earnings to be restated. The board can also act if an employee's conduct generates ''a material negative revision of a financial operating measure'' at the company. Finally, action can be taken against an employee who ''engages in fraud, theft, misappropriation, embezzlement or dishonesty to the material detriment of the company's financial results.'' Too much wiggle room, LongView contends. So it urged the board to eliminate the adjectives ''intentional'' and ''material'' from the policy. That way, it would cover any misconduct. And by removing the concept of materiality from the policy, McKesson's board would be less likely to ignore misconduct on the grounds that it was not pervasive or systemic. The definition of materiality is subjective, of course. Back in 2006, for example, McKesson paid $960 million to resolve a class action. In its regulatory filings, the company said it did not believe the resolution of this and other securities litigation would have a ''material adverse effect'' on the company's financial standing. Perhaps not, but applying such a high threshold to employee misconduct could overlook a significant case of fraud or misappropriation. The LongView fund's proposal also asked the board to disclose any discussions it has involving enforcement of the company's clawback policy going forward. This would give investors a better understanding of how McKesson's directors proceed in these matters. LongView conceded that cases might arise where privacy concerns outweighed the merits of a public disclosure. ''Clawbacks have become popular in the marketplace and investors like them,'' Mr. Zdrazil said. ''But we're at the point where investors rarely hear when clawbacks are used. Investors want greater transparency around these tools.'' McKesson tried to keep the LongView proposal from coming to a vote at the annual meeting, arguing unsuccessfully to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it should not be allowed on the company's proxy. Once it was included, the company encouraged its shareholders to reject it, saying that its current standard was appropriate, effective and balanced. McKesson also contended that LongView's call for disclosure of director deliberations about a potential recoupment was unnecessary and inappropriate. OTHER health care companies have taken a different approach, cooperating with investors like LongView that want tighter clawback provisions. Over the last year, LongView has worked with the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust and about a dozen other shareholders to develop principles for effective pay recovery programs at six pharmaceutical companies. Each of them -- Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer -- adopted the more rigorous principles before a shareholder proposal came up for a vote. Among them is the promise to disclose publicly when compensation is recouped. ''We see repeated regulatory and legal settlements coming out of corporate treasuries but rarely have we seen any indication of clawbacks being applied,'' Mr. Zdrazil said. ''Often settlements come with no wrongdoing provisions and the only people left on the hook for the payments are the share owners themselves. To help mitigate those legal and regulatory risks going forward we are interested in clawback policies with sharper teeth and more transparency in reporting to investors.'' It has taken a decade to get companies to talk the talk about executive pay clawbacks. That was viewed by investors as progress. Now, the question is: How many years before these companies walk the walk?N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.  ''SHOULD gold be a part of my portfolio?'' A friend posed that question to me a few weeks ago, after watching gold's wild ride over the last few years. The price of gold was less than $500 an ounce in 2005, but soared to more than $1,800 in 2011, before falling back to about $1,300 recently. He wasn't sure what to make of it all. My instinct was to say no. Like most economists I know, I am a pretty boring investor. I hold 60 percent stocks, 40 percent bonds, mostly in low-cost index funds. Whenever I see those TV commercials with some actor hawking gold coins, I roll my eyes. Hoarding gold seems akin to stocking up on canned beans and ammo as you wait for the apocalypse in your fallout shelter. But I was also wary of imposing my gut instinct on my friend, who was looking for a more reasoned judgment. I knew that some investors saw gold as a key part of a portfolio. The author Harry Browne, the onetime Libertarian presidential candidate, recommended a permanent 25 percent allocation to gold. In 2012, the Federal Reserve reported that Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, had more than $1 million of gold in his personal portfolio. So, before answering my friend's question, I dived into the small academic literature on gold as a portfolio investment. Here is what I learned: THERE ISN'T A LOT OF IT The World Gold Council estimates that all the gold ever mined amounts to 174,100 metric tons. If this supply were divided equally among the world's population, it would work out to less than one ounce a person. Warren E. Buffett has a good way to illustrate how little gold there is. He has calculated that if all the gold in the world were made into a cube, its edge would be only 69 feet long. So the cube would fit comfortably within a baseball infield. Despite its small size, that cube would have substantial value. In a recent paper released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Claude B. Erb and Campbell R. Harvey estimated that the value of gold makes up about 9 percent of the world's market capitalization of stocks, bonds and gold. Much of the world's gold, however, is out of the hands of private investors. About half of it is in the form of jewelry, and an additional 20 percent is held by central banks. This means that if you were to hold the available market portfolio, your asset allocation to gold would be about 2 percent. ITS REAL RETURN IS SMALL Over the long run, gold's price has outpaced overall prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index -- but not by much. In another recent N.B.E.R. paper, the economists Robert J. Barro and Sanjay P. Misra reported that from 1836 to 2011, gold earned an average annual inflation-adjusted return of 1.1 percent. By contrast, they estimated long-term returns to be 1.0 percent for Treasury bills, 2.9 percent for long-term bonds and 7.4 percent for stocks. Mr. Erb and Mr. Harvey presented a novel way of gauging gold's return in the very long run: they compared what the Roman emperor Augustus paid his soldiers, measured in units of gold, to what we pay the military today. They report remarkably little change over 2,000 years. The annual cost of one Roman legionary plus one Roman centurion was 40.9 ounces of gold. The annual cost of one United States Army private plus one Army captain has recently been 38.9 ounces of gold. To be sure, military pay is a narrow measure, but this comparison offers some support for the view that, on average, gold should keep pace with wage inflation, which, thanks to productivity growth, runs slightly ahead of price inflation. ITS PRICE IS HIGHLY VOLATILE Gold may offer an average return near that of Treasury bills, but its volatility is closer to that of the stock market. That has been especially true since President Richard M. Nixon removed the last vestiges of the gold standard. Mr. Barro and Mr. Misra report that since 1975, the volatility of gold's return, as measured by standard deviation, has been about 50 percent greater than the volatility of stocks. Because gold is a small asset class with meager returns and high volatility, an investor may be tempted to avoid it altogether. But not so fast. One last fact may turn the tables. IT MARCHES TO A DIFFERENT BEAT An important element of an investment portfolio is diversification, and here is where gold really shines -- pun intended -- because its price is largely uncorrelated with stocks and bonds. Despite gold's volatility, adding a little to a standard portfolio can reduce its overall risk. How far should an investor go? It's hard to say, because optimal portfolios are so sensitive to expected returns on alternative assets, and expected returns are hard to measure precisely, even with a century or two of data. It is therefore not surprising that financial analysts reach widely varying conclusions. In the end, I abandoned my initial aversion to holding gold. A small sliver, such as the 2 percent weight in the world market portfolio, now makes sense to me as part of a long-term investment strategy. And with several gold bullion exchange-traded funds now available, investing in gold is easy and can be done at low cost. I will continue, however, to pass on the canned beans and ammo.''We're at a moment when cultural power is passing to new gatekeepers.'' Joe Esposito, a publishing consultant. Last week, Barnes & Noble lost its C.E.O. as its digital plans floundered, Random House officially merged with Penguin, and a federal judge strengthened Amazon's position by ruling that Applehad illegally conspired with publishers to try to raise e-book prices. ''No supply means frenzy, and it means prices rise.'' Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, talking about the Manhattan housing market. The inventory of apartments for sale in Manhattan has reached the lowest levels in at least 13 years. The average price for a Manhattan apartment this spring was $1.425 million.MANU DAFTARY, manager of the Quaker Strategic Growth fund, says he learned a valuable lesson in 2009. He avoided companies like the American International Group, Bank of America and Citgroup, which, to one degree or another, were damaged by the subprime mortgage crisis and benefited from the help of the Federal Reserve. His portfolio's performance suffered, though, as he minimized investments in such companies. ''I kicked myself every day,'' he says. Mr. Daftary made a vow: Never again would he ignore the Fed and the companies that seem to profit most from its market interventions. That lesson appears to have served him well this year. His portfolio, laced with what were relatively out-of-favor companies, has thrived in a period of rock-bottom interest rates -- climbing nearly 16 percent through June. More broadly, the market has richly rewarded investors in many companies with weak balance sheets -- those that have relatively high debt loads. The Fed's policy of low interest rates has enabled such companies to refinance their debt more cheaply, often driving up their share prices. Goldman Sachs has found that stocks with weak balance sheets performed far better than those with strong balance sheets in the first half this year. Goldman tracks a marketbasket of 50 strong-balance-sheet stocks. It was up just 9 percent through June, far behind the 24.4 percent gain for a portfolio with the same number of weak-balance-sheet shares. Mr. Daftary owns a number of the stocks in the weak-balance-sheet basket. These include Anadarko Petroleum, Time Warner and CBS, all strong performers this year. The Goldman market basket doesn't include financial stocks. But the Quaker fund's portfolio does: It holds A.I.G., a company that has ''absolutely'' benefited from Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities, Mr. Daftary said. Don Hodges, who with his son Craig manages the Hodges Fund, also emphasizes out-of-favor stocks. ''The interest-rate environment is definitely a positive,'' he said. Across all industries, he added, ''companies are paying down debt.'' This is especially helpful to many companies whose share prices plunged as a result of the financial crisis. ''When everything gets trashed, stocks at the bottom of the pit get doubly trashed,'' Mr. Hodges said. He has done well with A. H. Belo, the newspaper chain, and Luby's, the restaurant company. Investors have recently fretted over the prospect of cutbacks later this year in the Fed's bond-buying program. Still, officials at the Fed have emphasized that its policy of near-zero short-term interest rates will not end soon. Low rates and strong investor demand for yield, meanwhile, have set a picnic table for some companies looking to raise cash and refinance debt at lower cost. Last year, there were 192 offerings of BB debt -- at the top end of speculative-grade ratings -- that raised $107.2 billion, according to Standard & Poor's. That was up from 126 companies and $68.5 billion in 2011. This year, the pace of BB borrowing has accelerated further. About half of the total $652 billion in speculative-grade bond and leveraged loan issuance in 2011 and 2012 has gone toward refinancing debt, typically at lower rates, according to S.& P. Apart from the benefits of Fed policies, stocks of companies with relatively weak financials have outperformed for another reason: many had become very cheap. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, stocks perceived as high risk were shunned, said Bill Miller, who manages the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust. ''Anything which had high perceived risk would tend to be radically mispriced,'' Mr. Miller said. The Legg Mason fund owns housing stocks like KB Home and Pulte, along with the mortgage insurers MGIC Investment and Genworth Financial, which declined sharply during the crisis. All have thrived lately. Fed policies like quantitative easing -- direct purchases of bonds and other securities -- have helped stock prices even as earnings growth has slowed, noted Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors. The positive effects of quantitative easing ''and the accompanying lower interest rates have been more powerful than has been the slowdown in earnings growth,'' he wrote in early June. Here's one example of how Fed policies have helped a company: MGIC, the mortgage insurer, suffered years of financial loses after the housing bubble burst. Share prices bottomed last August at less than $1 a share. But with Fed policies easing credit access while helping to lift both housing and equity markets, MGIC was able to raise more than $1 billion in March in convertible and secondary stock offerings Among the funds with the largest holdings in Goldman's weak-balance-sheet basket is DFA Tax-Managed U.S. Marketwide Value. Jed Fogdall is a manager of the fund, which has sizable holdings in Anadarko, Kraft Foods, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Time Warner, all big winners in the first half this year. The fund isn't necessarily looking for weak-balance-sheet stocks -- just cheap ones. It focuses on the 20 percent of Russell 1000 Value stocks that have the highest ratios of book-to-market value. ''We hold these stocks because they have a higher expected rate of return,'' Mr. Fogdall explained. If the Fed ends its stimulative monetary policy, stocks with weaker balance sheets could be hit hard, of course. While this is a risk, Mr. Hodges doesn't foresee an early end to the Fed's low-interest-rate policies. SOME fund managers, however, are not convinced that weak-balance-sheet stocks will continue to outperform. Jeff Constantino, manager of the MFS Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock fund, acknowledged the advantages that leveraged companies have had under Fed policies. ''They can roll over debt if they need to,'' he said. ''And they can refinance at lower rates.'' But he says he thinks their run may be nearing an end. ''It's possible that a lot of the outperformance of highly leveraged companies is behind us,'' he said. He's especially cautious about leveraged companies that also have cyclical characteristics. He cited the example of industrial supply companies, also known as industrial distributors. ''In the financial crisis, a lot of smaller industrial distributors weren't able to invest in inventory,'' he said. ''The financing was so tight and they didn't have the free cash flow.'' That provided an opportunity for a better-heeled company, W. W. Grainger, which the MFS portfolio holds. ''Grainger invested aggressively during the downturn,'' he said. ''They took substantial market share.'' Mr. Constantino isn't fighting the Fed. But he says he is trying to stick with quality. ''Even if we remain in a low-growth world with low interest rates, I still prefer to invest in high-quality companies with pricing power and significant cash flow that can be allocated to create value,'' he said.THE protests in Brazil last month were the latest vivid reminder of the perils of investing in emerging markets. Tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities, incited partly by a rising cost of living and a slowing economy. Cars burned. Tear gas billowed. And the Brazilian stock market sank. Yet Brazil was one of the investment darlings of the last decade -- the ''B'' in the ballyhooed BRIC quartet that also included Russia, India and China. Brazil's economy at times grew at a rate of more than 5 percent a year. Most years, its stock market rose by double digits -- in 2009, it returned more than 100 percent. Millions of people moved from poverty into the middle class, and Brazilian companies, like the oil driller Petrobras and the mining concern Vale, attained international prominence. So far this decade, though, the Brazilian stock market has been a bust. It has dropped by a cumulative 25.3 percent over the last three years, and it has dragged Latin America stock mutual funds down with it. In the first half of 2013, Latin America funds tracked by Morningstar lost almost 17 percent, on average. Over the last three years through June, they lost 4.6 percent a year, annualized. But over the much longer term, they have still fared the best among emerging-market regional funds tracked by Morningstar, returning 16.7 percent, annualized, over the last decade. ''Brazil needs to grow,'' said Will Landers, manager of the BlackRock Latin America fund. ''It has to deliver a G.D.P. growth rate above 2.5 percent, or investors are going to stay away.'' Growth sagged in 2012, with gross domestic product increasing less than 1 percent. As the bellwether for South American bourses, Brazil has had problems that affect investors in the entire region. Brazilian stocks account for nearly 60 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index and thus the same amount of passively managed funds, like the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America exchange-traded fund, that track the index. ''You're going to be investing in Brazil if you run a Latin America fund,'' said Andres Calderon, manager of the Natixis Hansberger Emerging Latin America fund. Brazilian stocks recently made up about two-thirds of the assets of both Mr. Calderon's and Mr. Landers's funds. Add in Mexico, the region's other big economy, and Latin America funds can end up looking like concentrated bets on a couple of countries. Mexican companies recently accounted for 25 percent of the MSCI index, 22 percent of the BlackRock fund's assets and 22 percent of the Natixis fund's assets. The remaining countries in the MSCI index are Chile, Colombia and Peru. Actively managed funds can typically hunt more broadly for investments than in just those five countries. BlackRock's fund, for example, recently held shares of Copa Airlines in Panama. But the relatively small size of economies and stock markets in Chile, Colombia and Peru can prevent them from adding much oomph to big portfolios. With a G.D.P. of about $250 billion, Chile's economy is roughly equal to Minnesota's, while Peru's is akin to Oregon's. Still, portfolio managers see promise in this trio, particularly Peru. ''Peru is the highest-growth country in Latin America,'' said Luis Carrillo, lead manager of the J.P. Morgan Latin America fund. ''It's growing at Chinese rates -- 7 to 8 percent annual G.D.P. growth for six or seven years. The government has learned that growth is the best way to bring people out of poverty.'' Peru's stock market remains nascent, without the diversity of companies typical of a mature market. ''So far, it's made up mainly of mining and metals companies, so it's more of a play on commodities,'' said Luiz Ribeiro, São Paulo-based manager of the DWS Latin America Equity fund. But domestic consumption is growing, and that should soon yield the kinds of consumer companies that Mr. Ribeiro and other managers say represent the future for stock investing in Latin America. Managers of Latin America funds often caution that the region and its markets, for all of their promise, remain volatile -- as recent events in Brazil have shown. Thus Adam J. Kutas, manager of the Fidelity Latin America fund, suggests a fund like his should account for no more than 5 percent to 10 percent of a typical diversified portfolio. ''These are markets that are earlier in their growth phase than the U.S. or Europe,'' Mr. Kutas said. ''They can add a lot of enhanced return, but you have to be comfortable with the risk.'' Some commentators recommend even greater conservatism. David Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer, an online newsletter, said that most retail investors might be better off staying away from any fund aimed at a single emerging region. ''You want to invest where you have a comparative advantage -- better contacts or better information,'' he said. Most retail investors have neither the contacts nor the expertise to determine whether they should overweight Latin American stocks as compared with, say, those of Asia or Eastern Europe, he said. Instead, he advised, they should stick with broadly diversified offerings. Mr. Kutas took a different view, noting that a growing number of people in the United States do have firsthand Latin America knowledge. Many have roots and family in the region, travel there regularly and speak Spanish or Portuguese. ''If you do have a personal connection, that can help you understand the risk you're taking on,'' he said. ''And if you want to invest in the region you come from or participate in the opportunities you see there, a Latin America fund is one way to do it.''''The Fed isn't just the U.S.'s central bank. It's the world's central bank.'' Mark Frey, chief strategist at the Cambridge Mercantile Group. In the weeks since the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, first indicated that the central bank might start to pare back its support for the economy, markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America have fallen even more sharply than those in the United States.

The hearings will tell whether Bank of America can extinguish legal liability for more than a million Countrywide Financial loans by paying $8.5 billion in cash and agreeing to loan servicing improvements in a settlement struck with 22 investors in 2011. But the case, being heard by Justice Barbara R. Kapnick, extends far beyond the impact of the settlement on Bank of America's balance sheet. It is also laying bare an industry practice that has put investors in mortgage securities at a disadvantage and reduced their financial recoveries in the aftermath of the home loan mania. The practice at issue involves trustee banks overseeing the vast and complex mortgage pools bought by pension funds, mutual funds and others. Trustees like Bank of New York Mellon were paid by investors to make sure that the servicers administering these mortgage deals, known as trusts, treated them properly. Trustees receive nominal fees -- less than a penny on each dollar of assets -- for the work. But when mortgages soured, trustees declined to pursue available remedies for investors, such as pushing a servicer to buy back loans that did not meet quality standards promised when the securities were sold. In other words, this case highlights a problem with trustees: they are a dog that could have barked but didn't. Before mortgage securities were undone by troubled loans, trustee inaction was not an issue. Trustees collected their fees at minimal effort and investors were satisfied. But because trustees are hired by the big banks that package and sell the securities, their allegiances are divided. Sure, investors are paying the fees, but if a trustee wants to be hired by sellers of securities in the future, being combative on problematic loan pools may be unwise. Trustee practices are under the microscope in Justice Kapnick's courtroom because Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee overseeing all 530 Countrywide mortgage deals covered by the proposed $8.5 billion settlement. The trustee is supporting the deal between Bank of America and the 22 investors that include BlackRock, Pimco and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Losses by all investors in the securities are projected at $100 billion. While lawyers for BlackRock and Pimco were negotiating this deal, other investors in the securities were not at the bargaining table. Nevertheless, they must abide by the settlement's terms. Some outside investors, including the American International Group, have objected, saying $8.5 billion is inadequate given the mountain of problem loans it covers. Lawyers for A.I.G. contend that Bank of New York put its interests ahead of other investors outside the settlement process. Had the trustee been more aggressive with Bank of America, the servicer administering the troubled securities, investors would have received more money in a settlement, A.I.G.'s lawyers say. Bank of New York Mellon argues that the settlement is reasonable and that it has always acted in the best interests of all investors. But over the last two weeks, arguments and testimony have shed light on behind-the-scenes dealings during the settlement negotiations with Bank of America. Some of these details raise questions about the trustee's assertiveness on behalf of all investors. A crucial issue: the trustee didn't request individual loan files from Bank of America to help determine how many mortgages had problems and, therefore, whether $8.5 billion was a reasonable recovery. A trustee has the right to request those files for investors who cannot get them on their own. When loan files have been examined, recoveries have been far greater. Last year, for example, Deutsche Bank agreed to reimburse Assured Guaranty, a bond insurer, for 80 percent of losses on eight residential mortgage securities it had insured. Asked about the basis for the $8.5 billion settlement, Kent Smith, a Pimco executive with experience in loan servicing, testified on June 7 that it came in part from an estimated percentage of problematic loans that was provided to the investors by Bank of America. But on cross-examination, he said the estimate was far lower than it would have been if Bank of New York Mellon had examined specific loan files. The estimate, 36 percent, meant that just over one-third of the loans had violated underwriting representations and warranties made to investors. But a review of the loan files would have pushed the figure as high as 65 percent, he testified. Additional testimony raised questions about fairness during the settlement talks. The 22 investors who struck the deal held at least 25 percent -- a required threshold for taking action -- in only 215 trusts, less than half the 530 covered by the settlement. No other investors had an advocate at the bargaining table. Asked who was representing investors outside the negotiating group, an in-house lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon said he did not know. Then there's an e-mail from Jason H. P. Kravitt, Bank of New York Mellon's outside counsel, recounting how he told Bank of America that on one important point its and the trustee's ''self-interest'' were aligned -- neither wanted the Countrywide securities to go into default. If they did default, the trustee would have been forced to increase its oversight of Bank of America, adding to its costs. If the trustee did not sue the bank, investors could. Referring to a default, Mr. Kravitt said he told a Bank of America lawyer, ''We don't want it either, Chris.'' Asked about these matters, Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York Mellon spokesman, said, ''We believe an $8.5 billion bird-in-the-hand settlement with significant servicing improvements is a far better result for all investors than the likely outcome following years of costly litigation.'' Trustees argue that they do not make enough money overseeing these loan pools to act on investors' behalf. But this could be resolved if the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed or encouraged trustees to use trust assets to pay for loan reviews or litigation. Justice Kapnick's decision is not expected for months, and will affect only this settlement. But the revelations in her courtroom send a message to investors who might have expected trustees to protect their interests with more vigor.ECONOMIC REPORTS Information to be released includes retail sales for April, business inventories for March, and China industrial production and retail sales for April (Monday); the import price index and euro area industrial production (Tuesday); the Producer Price Index and industrial production for April; capital flows for March, and the euro area gross domestic product for the first quarter (Wednesday); the Consumer Price Index for April, initial jobless claims, and housing starts for April (Thursday); the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for May, and leading indicators for April (Friday).

Users around New York and Philadelphia will be able to live-stream all the programming from ABC's local stations there, the first time that any major broadcaster has turned on such a technology. The functionality will be featured at ABC's upfront presentation for advertisers on Tuesday. It is, among other things, an attempt to keep up with the rapidly changing expectations of television viewers. It also reflects the increasing role that subscriber fees play in the broadcasting business: the live stream will be available only to paying subscribers of cable and satellite providers, even though the stations' signals are available free over the public airwaves. ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, said the live stream would be available in the other six cities where it owns stations sometime this summer. It is also in talks with the companies that own ABC's more than 200 affiliates to make the ''live'' button work in their markets. ABC finished the first of its affiliate deals, with Hearst Television, on Sunday afternoon; it said the live streams would work in Hearst's 13 markets, including Boston and Pittsburgh, in the coming months. The mobile app may prod the other broadcasters to follow ABC, much as they did seven years ago after the network started to stream full episodes of shows the morning after their TV premieres. ABC had originally planned to introduce a live-streaming feature for its apps in 2014, but decided to speed up that process this year. ''We keep a very close eye on consumer demand,'' said Anne Sweeney, the president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, which includes the broadcast network. ''We watch how people are behaving with their devices, and we really felt that we needed to move faster.'' Internally the project was code-named Project Acela, a reference to the high-speed train between Boston and Washington. A team led by Albert Cheng, Ms. Sweeney's executive vice president for digital media, was given a deadline of May 14, the date of the ABC upfront. While Apple devices came first, other phones and tablets will be supported in the coming months, Mr. Cheng said. Securing the necessary rights from programming providers was laborious, but ABC will be able to stream all of its stations' local newscasts, syndicated talk shows like ''Katie,'' and national series like ''Grey's Anatomy.'' The live-stream functionality comes at a time when ABC and its broadcast rivals are trying to keep the attention of audiences that are increasingly turning to cable channels and Internet streaming services like Netflix. It gives ABC another talking point about how it is adapting to audience preferences; in this case, viewers will be able to carry ''Good Morning America'' with them as they move around the house in the morning, or tune into a weekend basketball game while out with friends. The live stream will work anywhere in a local market, the same way an old-fashioned TV antenna would. During a demonstration of the app in her New York office on Friday, Ms. Sweeney said she was struck by how personalized television becomes when it is live-streamed to a person's phone. The app is also an implicit rebuttal to Aereo, the start-up backed by Barry Diller that is being sued by major station owners for streaming their signals to paying subscribers in New York. Ms. Sweeney reiterated her view that Aereo is illegal but said the plans for the app's live-stream feature predated the service. The app, to be named Watch ABC, in line with Disney's existing Watch Disney and Watch ESPN apps, will allow users to watch ABC shows on demand, like the network's previous app had. In the future, ABC will withhold its most recent TV episodes from the free versions of Hulu and ABC.com, further limiting access to paying subscribers of cable and satellite providers only. The mobile live stream will not carry the same ads as the television broadcast; instead, it will include the same sorts of digital ads as on ABC.com. This is in part because the Nielsen Company is not able to measure mobile viewing of live television yet. ''What you see here is the same live programming,'' Mr. Cheng said as he used the app, ''but what we are doing during the commercial break is actually inserting new ads into the stream.'' Over time, live-streaming of ABC stations could cannibalize big-screen viewing of those stations, but ABC could make up the difference through streaming ads. Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, pointed out this month that an increase in online advertising partly compensated for declines in TV ad revenue in the first quarter of the year. Transmitting television via live stream requires new deals with traditional distributors, like Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon FiOS, and with the owners of ABC's affiliates. Gaining Hearst's backing ahead of Tuesday's upfront was important to ABC because it lent some local support to the app effort. David Barrett, the chief executive of Hearst Television, said in a statement on Sunday that his company, recognizing ''that consumers want the ability to view our stations' programming on any device that has a screen,'' was eager to work with ABC on the app. Some station owners may bristle at ABC's arrangement, however, given the other mobile television efforts that are under way. In some cases, these efforts require a miniature antenna, or a dongle, to be plugged into the phone. A technology company called Syncbak has a live-streaming app for phones that does not require a dongle, but currently, it can carry only local programming, not syndicated or national programming. CBS took a minority stake in Syncbak last month, stoking talk that it might use the technology to live-stream the stations it owns. The Fox network, a unit of the News Corporation, is also known to be working on live-streaming functionality for its stations, though it is not expected to be available soon.MATT DRUDGE recently noted an anniversary of his aggregator news site with a Twitter post: ''18 years of DRUDGE REPORT in February! And STILL sitting ;).'' Mr. Drudge, 46, hasn't just been sitting for two decades. Like so many workers chained to their technology, he has been hunched over desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets, and it's all taken a toll on his body. He tries to limit the time he spends sitting to four or five hours a day, but sometimes he sits for up to 17 hours. To ease his back, neck and shoulder pain, Mr. Drudge says he has learned how to adjust his posture. Whether he's typing in the car, from the wooden folding chair in his Miami home office, or from a boardwalk bench at the beach on cloudy days, he makes sure to tilt the top of his pelvis forward, roll his shoulders back, elongate his spine and straighten his craned neck. Mr. Drudge is one of thousands of people who have trained with Esther Gokhale, a posture guru in Silicon Valley. She believes that people suffer from pain and dysfunction because they have forgotten how to use their bodies. It's not the act of sitting for long periods that causes us pain, she says, it's the way we position ourselves. Ms. Gokhale (pronounced go-CLAY) is not helping aching office workers with high-tech gadgets and medical therapies. Rather, she says she is reintroducing her clients to what she calls ''primal posture'' -- a way of holding themselves that is shared by older babies and toddlers, and that she says was common among our ancestors before slouching became a way of life. It is also a posture that Ms. Gokhale observed during research she conducted in a dozen other countries, as well as in India, where she was raised. For a method based not on technology but primarily on observations of people, it has been embraced by an unlikely crowd: executives, board members and staff members at some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies, including Google and Oracle; and heavy users of technology like Mr. Drudge. ''I need to do things that make sense and that I can see results from. Esther's work is like that,'' said Susan Wojcicki, 44, one of Google's senior vice presidents, who has suffered from back and neck pain that she attributes to doing too much work at her desk. Ms. Gokhale is not the first to suggest that changing posture is the key to a healthy spine. Practitioners of the Alexander Technique and the creators of the Aplomb Institute in Paris similarly help clients find more natural and comfortable ways to position themselves. Pilates and physical therapy can improve posture and bring awareness to it. A handful of companies, like Lumo BodyTech, now sell personal posture monitors, offering smartphone users constant feedback about the way they hold their bodies. Ms. Gokhale's methods have not been tested scientifically, though a doctor at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation is planning on conducting clinical trials by the end of the year. But Ms. Gokhale, who was trained as a biochemist at Princeton University and studied at Stanford's medical school, has some influence among medical professionals, particularly in Silicon Valley. Over 100 have referred patients to her, and a similar number have taken her course, she says. FOR many office workers in the United States, sitting at a desk all day goes hand in hand with back, neck and shoulder discomfort. Stress and poor positioning can bring on aches or exacerbate injuries among workers faced with heavy computing, constant travel and long meetings. Regardless of occupation or lifestyle, backaches affect most Americans -- about 8 in 10 deal with the pain at some point in their lifetimes, according to Dr. Richard Deyo, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health and Science University. The expenses are huge as well. By one estimate that appeared in The Journal of the American Medical Association, the national cost of treating people with back and neck pain was $86 billion in 2005. And with back pain one of the top reasons for worker disability, missed work because of these aches may cost employers close to $7 billion a year, according to one study. For the majority of people with back pain, the aches are short-lived and relief comes with rest and time, according to Dr. Deyo. But methods to help those with chronic pain are diverse. Using a standing desk at work has become a popular way to ease discomfort. Exercise, yoga, acupuncture and chiropractic have also been shown to reduce pain. Medical treatments like surgery and steroids continue to be important options, doctors say, even amid concerns that these have been overused. Dr. Haleh Agdassi, a rehabilitation doctor with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in California, sees back and neck pain so frequently among heavy users of computers that she calls it the ''Silicon Valley syndrome.'' She encourages clients to try a mix of nonsurgical strategies, but finds it frustrating that treatments for such a common problem are only modestly effective. ''There's no magic bullet out there for back pain,'' she says. ''That can be overwhelming for patients. It's an anxious, vulnerable crowd -- they're looking for solutions.'' Ms. Gokhale, 52, can relate to the anxiety of searching for an answer. She previously dealt with pain in her lower back, first as a college student practicing yoga, then as a young mother with sciatica. She eventually had surgery for a herniated disk, but it failed, she said. When doctors suggested she try a second time, Ms. Gokhale began a search for other answers. Many of her own clients come to her similarly exasperated, she said. Mr. Drudge read Ms. Gokhale's book, ''8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back,'' before training with her in person. ''I needed her touch, her observations and her humanity,'' he said. Donna Dubinsky, co-founder and former chief executive of Palm, worked with Ms. Gokhale two years ago after trying chiropractic, cortisone shots and physical therapy to minimize the pain of herniated disks in her back. ''All of these other things were about symptom relief. The question for me became: what could I do to address the root cause?'' said Ms. Dubinsky, 57, who now stands during many meetings to practice Ms. Gokhale's posture lessons. ''Not that it's a miracle cure, but of all the things I've tried, what Esther taught me was the most effective,'' she added. IN Ms. Gokhale's courses, offered in her Palo Alto, Calif., studio and in cities across the country, students relearn how to sit, stand, sleep and walk. While some clients take private classes, many enroll in group workshops with eight to 10 people who meet for six 90-minute sessions. While the students are often strangers, the classes are casual and intimate: most clients wear yoga clothes or sweat pants, and they giggle awkwardly as Ms. Gokhale adjusts their bodies. Ms. Gokhale says that most Americans tend to be relaxed and slumped (think of a C-shaped spine), or arched up and tense (an S shape), the stand-up-straight style of posture that some parents demand of their children. She helps her students return their bodies to the stance that she says nature intended: upright and relaxed (a tall J spine). With the care of a kindergarten teacher, Ms. Gokhale adjusts clients' bodies from bottom to top. She helps clients relax the front of the pelvis downward, so the belt line slants forward and the butt angles back, so ''your behind is behind you, not under you'' (a contrast to the neutral pelvis recommended in Pilates and some physical therapy). Ms. Gokhale guides students' rib cages that sway too far back, so they are flush with the stomach. She takes their hunched shoulders, rolls them up and brings them gently back and down. And she helps students release tension in their necks by re-centering their heads over their spines and pulling upward slightly at the hairline on the neck. The result is an elongated and well-stacked spine that many students say they can maintain comfortably because their muscles are not strained. Ray Bingham, 67, the presiding director of Oracle's board, was referred to Ms. Gokhale last fall for his lower back pain. Mr. Bingham says he has found relief after using her methods and he diligently practices his newfound ways of sitting, walking and standing. ''This is not an approach like physical therapy with a beginning and an end; this is a new way of being from now on,'' Mr. Bingham said. Ms. Gokhale encourages people to take the class with co-workers and family members, so that students can help remind each other to adjust their bodies. But even those who work alone find ways to remember their posture. After doing a group workshop with Ms. Gokhale this year, Mr. Drudge says many things now remind him to make adjustments -- seeing others with poor posture at Starbucks or the gym, passing by his reflection in a window, or sitting down in a chair to work. ''But I don't beat myself up about it. When I'm aware of my posture, I fix it,'' Mr. Drudge said. ''And eventually, I think, it becomes who you are.''''The carriers are not innocent in this whole game. They are making profit off this.'' Cathy L. Lanier, chief of the police department of the District of Columbia, where a record 1,829 cellphones were taken in robberies last year. Despite a nationwide database for stolen cellphones, there is an ever-rising number of phone thefts, in part because many stolen phones end up overseas, out of the database's reach, and in part because phones' identifiers are easily modified.

The first Twitter message from Warren Buffett, which he posted last Thursday morning. By midafternoon, it had been retweeted 20,000 times and he had nearly 130,000 followers.The American economy appears to be bucking the headwinds from Washington, buoyed by healthy business activity and resilient consumers. The latest evidence came on Friday with a better-than-expected report on industrial production, led by a jump in the automobile sector. It follows bullish indicators earlier in the week, including a drop in new unemployment claims and strong retail sales. The data has surprised economists like Ethan Harris of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who on Friday revised upward the company's prediction for growth in the first quarter to 3 percent from an earlier estimate of 2 percent. Many experts had been looking for more of a drag from the restoration of full Social Security taxes in January and the automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending that began March 1, a process known as sequestration. ''It feels like the economy has some momentum and is in a little bit better shape to handle the sequester,'' Mr. Harris said. While higher taxes and lower federal spending are a ''speed bump,'' he said, ''the economy has better shock absorbers.'' Industrial production jumped 0.7 percent in February, the biggest gain in three months, the Federal Reserve said. Economists had been expecting a 0.4 percent rise. Factory production and hiring are being bolstered in part by a rebound in China, which is driving output and exports among many major corporations, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. The Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, slowed last summer and fall but regained momentum in recent months. To be sure, there are still reasons to be cautious, particularly in spring and early summer, when the combined force of Washington's fiscal restraint is expected to have its biggest impact. Gasoline prices have also been rising. Higher gas prices helped lift consumer prices by 0.7 percent in February, although the less volatile core reading that is closely followed by the Fed was up just 0.2 percent, according to other data released Friday by the Labor Department. The jump in payroll taxes and gas prices is squeezing lower-income consumers in particular, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG. Big-ticket items like homes and cars continue to sell well, but otherwise-strong retail sales data out earlier this week showed that spending at restaurants declined for the second month in a row. ''People who can't afford it aren't going out as much to eat,'' Mr. Blitz said. Consumer confidence is also shaky. The preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan reading for March showed an unexpected drop Friday, dropping to 71.8, from 77.6 in February, its lowest level since December 2011. But so far consumers have not markedly changed their spending habits; retail sales data on Wednesday was better than had been expected. The improved retail spending over all was the ''clincher'' in Mr. Harris's decision to raise his forecast for growth. Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said that the wariness of consumers in the new survey ''may simply be a vote of no confidence in the government and the problems in Washington. It may not be represented in what consumers do.'' According to Mr. Gault, the most important factor underlying the economy's recent strength is an improving housing sector -- a trend that may be further confirmed next week when Februrary statistics are released on housing starts and home sales. Not only do consumers feel more confident about spending when home values are rising, Mr. Gault said, but growth in the housing sector also results in greater demand for goods like furniture, carpeting and other furnishings. There are suggestions of that kind of trickle-down in other recent economic reports. Of the 236,000 jobs the government reported as being created in February, 48,000 were in the construction sector. Similarly, building supplies were among the strongest components in the most recent report on retail sales. ''Housing helps everything,'' said Mr. Gault, who also lifted his estimates for growth in the first quarter. Like Mr. Harris and several other economic forecasters, he also foresees a temporary slowdown in the second quarter when the worst fallout from the sequester and the higher taxes is expected to show up in the economy's Geiger counters. Despite the more robust indicators in recent weeks, the Fed is expected to maintain its efforts to keep interest rates ultralow and pump tens of billions of dollars into the economy each month, a policy known as quantitative easing. The majority of Fed officials have said they would not consider a shift in policy as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent. Fed policy makers are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday. While unemployment has come down slowly from its recent high of 10 percent, economists say the Fed's easy money policy has been integral to keeping the economy moving, as well as lifting the stock market to new highs. The Fed is pumping $85 billion into the financial system each month -- about what the sequester will drain from the economy between now and Sept. 30, said Maury Harris, chief United States economist at UBS. The money created by the Fed's policies is slowly filtering its way through the economy as banks ease lending standards and increase some lines of credit. ''It's not as quick as everyone hoped, but the money is being deployed,'' said Mr. Harris. ''It has a lot of knock-on effects.''Robert J. Shiller, professor of economics and finance at Yale, has collaborated with Barclays Bank on a family of indexes and investment products.  THE recovery in housing, the stock market and the overall economy has finally gained sustainable momentum -- or so it is said. That opinion seems to be based on several salient facts. Unemployment has been declining, from 10.0 percent in October 2009 to 7.7 percent last month. More spectacularly, the stock market has more than doubled since 2009 and has been especially strong for the last six months, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching record closing highs last week and the S.& P. 500 flirting with superlatives, too. And the housing market, seasonally adjusted, has been rising. The S.& P./Case-Shiller 20-city home price index gained 7 percent in 2012. These vital signs make many people believe that we've turned the corner on the economy, that we've started a healing process. And their discussions often note one particular sign of systemic recovery: confidence. There is considerable hope that the markets are heralding a major development: that Americans have lost the fears and foreboding that have made the financial crisis of 2008 so enduring in its effects. Hope is a wonderful thing. But we also need to remember that changes in the stock market, the housing market and the overall economy have relatively little to do with one another over years or decades. (We economists would say that they are only slightly correlated.) Furthermore, all three are subject to sharp turns. The economy is a complicated system, with many moving parts. So, amid all those complications, there are other possibilities: Could we be approaching another major stock market peak? Will the housing market's takeoff be short-lived? And could we dip into another recession? There are certainly risks. Congress is mired in struggles over the budget crisis and the national debt. The government is questioning the risk to taxpayers in its huge support of housing through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration and the Federal Reserve. Problems in Europe, Asia and the Middle East could easily shift people's confidence. There have been abrupt and significant changes in confidence in European markets since 2009. Is there any reason to think that the United States is immune to similar swings? For years, I've been troubled by the problem of understanding the social psychology and economic impact of confidence. There hasn't been much research into the emotional factors and the shifts in worldview that drive major turning points. The much-quoted consumer sentiment and confidence indexes don't yet seem able to offer insight into what's behind the changes they quantify. It also isn't clear which factors of confidence drive the separate parts of the economy. Along with colleagues, I have been conducting surveys about aspects of stock market confidence. For example, since 1989, with the help of some colleagues at Yale, I have been collecting data on the opinions and ideas of institutional investors and private individuals. These data, and indexes constructed from them, can be found on the Web site of the Yale School of Management. I have called one of these indexes ''valuation confidence.'' It is the percentage of respondents who think that the stock market is not overvalued. Using the six-month moving average ended in February, it was running at 72 percent for institutional investors and 62 percent for individuals. That may sound like a ton of confidence, but it isn't as high as the roughly 80 percent recorded in both categories just before the market peak of 2007. HOW do the these figures relate to other stock market measures? I rely on the measure of stock market valuation that Prof. John Campbell of Harvard and I developed more than 20 years ago. Called the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE, this measure is the real, or inflation-adjusted, Standard & Poor's 500 index divided by a 10-year average of real S.& P. earnings. The CAPE has been high of late: it stands at 23, compared with a historical average of around 15. This suggests that the market is somewhat overpriced and might show below-average returns in the future. (The use of the 10-year average reduces the impact of short-run, or cyclical, components of earnings.) For perspective, compare today's valuation, confidence and CAPE figures to those of other important recent periods in the stock market. In the spring of 2000, a sharp market peak, only 33 percent of institutional investors and 28 percent of individual investors thought that the market was not overvalued. The CAPE reached 46, a record high based on data going back to 1871. (For the period before 1926, we rely on data from Alfred Cowles 3rd & Associates.) Yet most respondents in 2000 thought that the market would go up in the next year, so they hung in for the time being. That suggests that the 1990s boom was indeed a bubble, with investors suspecting that they might have to beat a hasty exit. They ended up trying to do just that, and brought the market down. But then consider the valuation confidence in October 2007, another major peak, after which the stock market fell by more than 50 percent in real terms. At that peak, the CAPE was at 27 -- a little higher than it is now, though not extraordinarily lofty. In 2007, valuation confidence was 82 percent for institutional investors and 74 percent for individual investors, or not far from today's levels. Investors at the time didn't think that they were floating on a bubble, and they saw the probability of a stock market crash as unusually low. Yet a plunge soon occurred. The cause appears not to have been so much the bursting of an overextended bubble but the subprime mortgage crisis and a string of financial failures that most investors couldn't have known about. Clearly, confidence can change awfully fast, and people can suddenly start worrying about a stock market crash, just as they did after 2007. Today, the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory changes may help prevent another crisis. Even so, regulators can't do much about some of the questionable thinking that seems to drive changes in confidence. For example, why is a record high in the United States stock market a reason for optimism? Nothing is remarkable about reaching a market record: the S.& P. Composite Index has done it 1,007 times, based on daily closes, since the beginning of 1928. That's about once every 23 trading days, on average, though the new records tend to come in bunches. The important fact is that we haven't set a nominal stock-market record in six years. And we haven't set one in 13 years if we use the inflation-corrected S.& P. Composite total-return index. That this index may be about to set a record means only that we haven't made any real money in the stock market in 13 years, which hardly seems a reason for confidence. But public thinking is inscrutable. We can keep trying to understand it, but we'll be puzzled again the next time the markets or the economy make major moves.TWO weeks ago, I wrote a column about a secret agreement struck in July 2012 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bank of America. The existence of the confidential deal was disclosed recently in court filings, which showed the New York Fed releasing Bank of America from all fraud claims on mortgage securities the Fed had bought as part of the government's rescue of the American International Group in 2008. A.I.G., which is suing Bank of America to recover losses it suffered on those securities, has calculated the value of the fraud claims at $7 billion. Late on Thursday, a copy of the actual agreement came to light. It was filed by Bank of America in a California court that is hearing the matter of who owns those fraud claims -- A.I.G. or the New York Fed. The agreement was also filed by the New York Fed in a related lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, where the New York Fed asked that the court keep the agreement under seal. A reading of the document makes it clear why. The agreement spells out the terms of a deal in which the New York Fed received $43 million from Bank of America's Countrywide unit. The money changed hands to settle a narrow dispute involving cash flows on several mortgage securities held by an investment vehicle, known as Maiden Lane II. That vehicle was created by the New York Fed as part of the rescue of A.I.G., which had held the Countrywide securities. The previously confidential agreement released Bank of America from all litigation claims on the securities held by Maiden Lane II. But in exchange for that $43 million, the New York Fed did something else for Bank of America. It agreed to testify on behalf of the bank in its legal battle against A.I.G. over fraud claims. In that matter, Bank of America has argued that A.I.G. has no right to sue it for fraud because A.I.G. sold the securities to Maiden Lane II and so transferred the litigation rights to the New York Fed. A.I.G., however, maintains that the Maiden Lane agreement never specified the transfer of the right to sue for fraud and that an explicit transfer is required by New York law, which governs the agreement. The New York Fed provided Bank of America with two affidavits supporting the bank's view of who owned the mortgage securities' fraud claims. Two weeks ago, it was unclear why the New York Fed gave Bank of America the affidavits. But now, its promise to testify ''as needed,'' shown in the formerly confidential settlement, addresses that oddity. It was a contractual obligation. Interestingly, the New York Fed did not tell the California court that its affidavits came about because of its deal with Bank of America. The affidavits came from James M. Mahoney, a vice president at the New York Fed, and Stephanie A. Heller, its deputy general counsel. But those affidavits differ from the position taken earlier by Thomas C. Baxter Jr., the New York Fed's general counsel. In a letter to A.I.G. in October 2011, Mr. Baxter said that he and his colleagues ''agree that A.I.G. has the right to seek damages'' under securities laws for the instruments it sold to Maiden Lane II. Michael Carlinsky, A.I.G.'s lawyer at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said on Friday that he found it ''disturbing'' that the New York Fed made a contract to ''assist Bank of America in its defense of A.I.G.'s lawsuit.'' Also on Friday, I asked the New York Fed why it had included this promise of legal support for Bank of America in the settlement agreement. Jack Gutt, a spokesman, said in a statement that the New York Fed had intended to hold the litigation rights and that the declarations were true. ''The New York Fed did not agree to provide the declarations to benefit B. of A., but rather because doing so helped the New York Fed obtain the best possible settlement'' for Maiden Lane II, Mr. Gutt said. ''In agreeing to this provision as part of what the New York Fed believed was a favorable settlement agreement, the New York Fed was concerned exclusively with advancing the taxpayer interest.'' I also asked a Bank of America spokesman whether the bank had paid more in the settlement because of the New York Fed's promise to testify. He declined to answer that question, saying, ''Countrywide provided fair value for a complete release of claims by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Fed agreed to provide testimony standing behind what it had formally represented to Countrywide regarding the assignment of claims from A.I.G.'' Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College who has written extensively about financial regulators who are too close to the industries they regulate, discussed with me the unusual terms of the New York Fed's deal with Bank of America. ''The Fed seems to have thrown off all restraints on its behavior in just trying to get through the crisis and the aftermath of the crisis,'' Mr. Kane said. ''It's like a slippery slope, and they just keep sliding a little further.'' The New York Fed was also criticized last week in a related ruling by Lewis A. Kaplan, a federal judge for the Southern District of New York. A.I.G. had asked Judge Kaplan to oversee the dispute over who -- A.I.G. or Maiden Lane II -- owns the fraud claims in these securities. Even though the Maiden Lane agreement required that any disputes between the New York Fed and A.I.G. be heard in a New York court, the New York Fed argued that the matter should be decided in California. Although Judge Kaplan declined to take the case from the California court, he said in his ruling that the New York Fed appeared to be trying ''to circumvent and defeat the forum selection clause to which it is bound by its agreement with A.I.G.'' The New York Fed's actions, he wrote, ''perhaps are unattractive and, indeed, wrongful.'' Mr. Gutt said that the New York Fed was not trying to ''defeat a forum selection clause, but rather to fulfill a contractual obligation.'' The federal judge's words are nonetheless strong. And they highlight the reputational risk that the New York Fed may have taken on as a result of these events. Of course, the reputations of many financial institutions have taken a beating in the years after the crisis, as Sarah Bloom Raskin, a governor of the Federal Reserve System, acknowledged in a speech last Thursday. Her remarks, titled ''Reflections on Reputation and Its Consequences'' and delivered at a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta conference, explored the reputational damage suffered recently by United States financial institutions. Ms. Raskin called on policy makers to think about reputation as it relates to the banks they oversee. If examiners are watchful for threats to an institution's reputation, she said, other risks posed to investors, creditors, trading partners and taxpayers may come to light. ''Sociologists and economists have long remarked upon the central role that social trust plays in healthy markets,'' she said, according to her written remarks. ''Social trust is the glue that holds markets and societies together. In the context of banking, social trust and reputation are related concepts.'' Surely this holds true in the context of central banking as well.MANY people became rightfully upset about bailouts given to big banks during the mortgage crisis. But it turns out that they are still going on, if more quietly, through the back door. The existence of one such secret deal, struck in July between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bank of America, came to light just last week in court filings. That the New York Fed would shower favors on a big financial institution may not surprise. It has long shielded large banks from assertive regulation and increased capital requirements. Still, last week's details of the undisclosed settlement between the New York Fed and Bank of America are remarkable. Not only do the filings show the New York Fed helping to thwart another institution's fraud case against the bank, they also reveal that the New York Fed agreed to give away what may be billions of dollars in potential legal claims. Here's the skinny: Late last Wednesday, the New York Fed said in a court filing that in July it had released Bank of America from all legal claims arising from losses in some mortgage-backed securities the Fed received when the government bailed out the American International Group in 2008. One surprise in the filing, which was part of a case brought by A.I.G., was that the New York Fed let Bank of America off the hook even as A.I.G. was seeking to recover $7 billion in losses on those very mortgage securities. It gets better. What did the New York Fed get from Bank of America in this settlement? Some $43 million, it seems, from a small dispute the New York Fed had with the bank on two of the mortgage securities. At the same time, and for no compensation, it released Bank of America from all other legal claims. When I asked the Fed to discuss this gift to the bank, it declined. To understand how the settlement happened, we must go back to the dark days of September 2008. With the giant insurer A.I.G. teetering, the government stepped in. As part of the rescue, A.I.G. sold mortgage securities to an investment vehicle called Maiden Lane II overseen by the New York Fed. A.I.G. was bleeding from its toxic mortgage holdings, many of which were issued by Bank of America, and it received $20.8 billion for securities with a face value of $39.2 billion. In 2011, aiming to recover some of that $18 billion loss, the insurer sued Bank of America for fraud. The case, filed in New York state court, sought $10 billion in damages from the bank, $7 billion of that related to securities that A.I.G. sold to Maiden Lane II. Bank of America, for its part, argued that A.I.G. had no standing to sue for fraud on the Maiden Lane securities. With the sale, Bank of America contended, the right to bring a legal claim against the bank for fraud passed to Maiden Lane II. That entity, controlled by the New York Fed, never brought fraud claims against the bank. Not so fast, said A.I.G. Under New York law, which governs Maiden Lane II, an entity has to explicitly transfer the right to sue for fraud, it said. The original agreement between the New York Fed and A.I.G. never specified such a transfer, the insurer contended. To settle this question, A.I.G. filed a separate lawsuit against Maiden Lane II in a New York court last month. A.I.G.'s $10 billion fraud case against Bank of America, meanwhile, was moved to federal court. For pretrial purposes, the bank asked that Mariana R. Pfaelzer, a federal judge in the central district of California, oversee aspects of the case involving the bank's Countrywide unit, which was in California. Its request was granted. On Jan. 30, Judge Pfaelzer said she would rule on the issue of who owns the legal claims. Initially, in an October 2011 letter to A.I.G., the New York Fed agreed that the insurer had the right to seek damages under securities laws on instruments it sold to Maiden Lane II. But more recently, the New York Fed began helping Bank of America battle A.I.G. In late December, the New York Fed provided two declarations to the bank. One stated that Maiden Lane II had ''intended'' to receive all litigation claims relating to the mortgage securities, meaning that it alone would have had the right to sue. Another said that the October letter was not an interpretation of the Maiden Lane agreement. But Jon Diat, an A.I.G. spokesman, said in a statement that ''A.I.G. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York never discussed or agreed on any transfer of A.I.G.'s residential mortgage-backed securities fraud claims to Maiden Lane II.'' He added that A.I.G. believes ''it is the rightful owner of these claims and remains committed to holding Bank of America and other counterparties responsible for the harm caused.'' LAST week, the New York Fed opposed A.I.G.'s efforts to have the question of who owns the legal rights decided in New York, whose law governs the Maiden Lane II agreement, rather than in California. It was in this filing that the New York Fed disclosed its confidential July 2012 deal with Bank of America, releasing it of any liability arising from fraud in the Maiden Lane II securities. Let's recap: For zero compensation, the New York Fed released Bank of America from what may be sizable legal claims, knowing that A.I.G. was trying to recover on those claims. To anyone interested in holding banks accountable for mortgage improprieties, the Fed's actions are bewildering. If the Fed intended that Maiden Lane II own the right to sue Bank of America for fraud, why didn't it pursue such a potentially rich claim on behalf of taxpayers? The Fed made $2.8 billion on the Maiden Lane II deal, but the recovery from Bank of America could have been much greater. Why did it instead release Bank of America from these liabilities and supply declarations that seem to support the bank in its case against A.I.G.? The New York Fed would not discuss this matter, citing the litigation. But taxpayers, who might have benefited had the New York Fed brought fraud claims, deserve answers to these questions. In an interview, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who serves on the Banking Committee, said the New York Fed's behavior in this case ''underscores that the more we learn about these bailouts, gifts and advantages that Wall Street gets, the clearer it becomes that one set of rules applies to the largest megabanks and another set of rules to the smaller financial institutions and the rest of the country.'' A court will decide who actually owns these particular fraud claims against Bank of America. But the issue of Bank of America's responsibility for paying for the misdeeds of Countrywide during the financial crisis remains much at issue. The New York Fed is among a group of institutions that agreed in 2011 to settle with the bank for pennies on the dollar over mortgage securities its Countrywide unit misrepresented as high quality when they were sold. That deal, for $8.5 billion, has not been approved by the court. Other mortgage securities investors have objected to it, calling the amount too small. A New York Fed spokesman said it supported the settlement because it would generate significant value without potentially high litigation costs. But Walker F. Todd, a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, warned: ''As a public entity, the Federal Reserve needs to take its custody of public funds seriously enough to ask for more than merely nominal compensation when it is giving up things of value to a bank holding company. If the central bank starts releasing binding legal claims for nominal compensation, it looks like just one more element of the secret or back-door bailout of the banking system.'' Sure does.I HAVEN'T a clue what kind of psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was. But I do know she was a terrific financial planner. Dr. Kübler-Ross, who died in 2004, is best known for identifying the five stages of grief that people go through once they understand they are dying. And those stages -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance -- describe perfectly my reactions when I read recently that, according to Fidelity Investments, my wife, Alison, and I will need to save eight times our current annual income to come even close to having the kind of retirement we want. Here's how I reacted when I got the depressing news, which came as I was assembling our financial records in order to do our taxes. DENIAL ''That figure can't possibly be correct. Eight times annual income? How can any couple possibly put away that kind of money? They can't. Clearly, it's a typo. Has to be. That's it, someone has the number wrong. Good. Now I feel better. I am not going to think about it any more.'' But, unfortunately, countless people have cited that multiple, or even more chilling ones, as a retirement savings goal. Denial was out. What replaced it? ANGER ''Those financial planners haven't a clue what things cost in the real world! We had four kids to put through college. Then there is our home, an 1870 farmhouse that should have come with a live-in electrician, plumber and carpenter. And do you know what we are paying in property taxes? We have been conscientious about saving for retirement, and now you tell me we aren't even close! This is America. There has to be somebody I can blame for this.'' Ranting made me feel better -- and I pretended that I didn't hear Alison mumble under her breath that I was acting like a toddler long overdue for his nap. Once I wore myself out, I figured that there was some way I could cut a deal or figure out an angle. That eight-times-income figure must contain some wiggle room. BARGAINING ''O.K. We'll need eight times our income. Well, 7.5 would round up to 8, right? So maybe we can get away with that. And maybe I'll just put in 60 hours a week until I'm 83. Beyond generating more money, that would cut down on retirement time. But that's probably not going to work. Who the heck will hire me when I am 83? Well, what if we cut our current income in half? That would make the 7.5 times figure doable, although I am not quite sure how we would pay the mortgage. Or we could ... . '' When I couldn't find any way around the problem, I was, just as Dr. Kübler-Ross predicted, miserable. DEPRESSION ''How could this have happened? I write about this stuff in my work. I know that retirement is expensive and that people are living longer than ever, which means the money has to go even further. This is awful. I should have seen this coming. I wonder how cat food tastes?'' Fortunately, I don't have the discipline to wallow. My attention span is too short. And so, in a surprisingly short amount of time, I broke through to the other side. ACCEPTANCE ''Well, facts are facts. We are not going to have eight times our current income socked away when we finally hang it up. Probably not seven, either. But you know what? To quote that great sage William Stephen Belichick, otherwise known as the head coach of the New England Patriots, 'It is what it is.' ''And there are some advantages in the fact that we are going to fall short. For one thing, I don't have to agonize every day whether our retirement accounts closed up or down. The final figure will be, to quote Bill, whatever it is, and I think I am O.K. with that. ''We can't increase our retirement savings contributions without jeopardizing how we live now -- and I like how we live now. And I am not going to regret the fact that we paid for the kids to go to the colleges of their choice (although it would have been nice if even one had picked a state school). ''Yes, we have home-repair services on speed-dial, but Alison loves this place, faulty wiring and all. And the saying is on target: Happy wife, happy life. ''Given all this, I am going to be O.K. with whatever number we end up with when we retire. If we remain diligent, it looks as if we will have about six times current income. And between that and Social Security, we will make do. I am at peace with it. Effective today, I am not going to spend hours agonizing over whether to save tax-deferred or not. I am going to make one decision -- with a lot of help from our accountant -- and let it go.'' WHAT have I accomplished by going through these five stages of grief? Well, I have to tell you that I am happier for having reached this point. And I know that I won't have to live on cat food, but I have tripled-checked the numbers just to make sure. I am not arguing that you should give up on saving money for retirement. Rather, I think that you should try to save as much as you can, but that when you have done all that you humanly can do, accept it. The good doctor was right.TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER left the Treasury Department last week after four years as secretary. So how did he do? As financial adviser to the president in the tumultuous years immediately after the credit crisis, Mr. Geithner had immense sway over the government's approach to all things economic. For everyday Americans, his major tasks included responding to the home foreclosure mess, unwinding federal bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and tackling the problem of financial institutions that are too big to manage and too interconnected for America's good. But in scanning these agenda items, a pattern of winners and losers emerges. Let's just say the financial institutions that dominate the United States were rarely on the losing end in the Geithner years. I wanted to speak with Mr. Geithner to allow him to respond to his critics and to get his take on his years in the job. A spokeswoman said he was on vacation and unavailable. So I turned to the Treasury's Web site, where I found a list of 75 facts about Mr. Geithner's tenure. Among other things, I learned that on his watch the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed its two biggest penalties against banks for money-laundering and that the Treasury Department cracked down on offshore tax evasion. I also found he has logged more than 600,000 miles on international trips, played basketball in China and cricket in India, and has his signature on $17 billion of United States currency. Clearly, Mr. Geithner was busy. He had to deal with severe financial troubles overseas, navigate relationships with China and Europe and negotiate with Congress on contentious tax matters. Mr. Geithner has spoken to other journalists about the work that he and his colleagues did in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He said that this work ''was incredibly effective for the broad interest of the economy and the financial system,'' and that he believed his financial reform efforts ''will significantly reduce the probability and the intensity of crises for a long period of time.'' He also denied that bankers have too much political influence in Washington. That's news to Jeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Ted Kaufman, a former Democratic senator from Delaware. Mr. Connaughton, author of ''The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins,'' said he believed that Treasury's kid-glove treatment of the big banks would have the lasting effect of ensuring future crises. While banks recovered quickly and the Dow is around 14,000, he said last week, ''the economy is still sputtering for millions of Americans whose livelihoods were devastated by the financial crisis.'' He added: ''The legal and regulatory framework that Geithner leaves behind for preventing a future financial crisis inspires little confidence, especially amid scandals emerging almost weekly at banks too big and complex to manage, regulate, police and fail.'' How did Treasury favor the banks? Consider its answer to the foreclosure mess. After promising to help four million borrowers, its Home Affordable Modification Program at last count had helped about one-quarter of that number. One reason for this is that the program was flawed from the start. First, the Treasury made the program voluntary, awarding funds to participating banks but failing to penalize those that did not. The program was all carrot, no stick. Worse, the initial plan didn't require the banks to write down second liens they may have held -- like home equity lines -- from borrowers whose original loans were modified. This let the banks put their interests ahead of both borrowers and those who held the first mortgages. Unwinding the Troubled Asset Relief Program was another area where the department fell short. Eager to trumpet the success of TARP and other bailout programs, for example, Treasury boasted last spring that taxpayers would likely make money on them. Such a claim, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, should ''immediately discredit the teller.'' Treasury's accounting for TARP and the other programs didn't factor in the below-market rates the recipients paid on these loans. ''We did them an enormous favor,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview last week, ''at a time when liquidity commanded an incredible premium.'' Neither, critics say, was Treasury transparent about TARP or willing to provide data to Congress on the program's progress. ''Under Secretary Geithner's leadership, Treasury consistently overstated the results of its actions, painting a rosier picture than reality,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ''Without the special inspector general, the public wouldn't have a clear, numbers-driven point of view on TARP.'' FINALLY, there's the matter of Treasury's response to the weightiest issue of all: banks that are too large to succeed. Back in 2010, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Mr. Kaufman were co-sponsors of the Safe Banking Act, which proposed placing tough limits on banks' size. If it had passed, it would have imposed a strict 10 percent cap on any bank holding company's share of United States deposits and set a 6 percent limit on leverage. The act was a way to begin reining in the huge institutions that had caused so much trouble in the credit debacle. It could also have protected taxpayers from having to make future rescues. A good thing for Main Street, in other words. But it was not to be. Among the bill's most aggressive opponents was, yes, the Treasury. ''We were disappointed,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview on Thursday. ''Not only did Treasury oppose it, but they proudly opposed it. If the Treasury had spoken out for it we could have gotten very close to winning.'' Thankfully, Mr. Brown has not given up on the idea of reducing big banks' size and threat to taxpayers. He and Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, have asked the Government Accountability Office to quantify the size of the advantages -- and implied taxpayer subsidies -- that large financial institutions enjoy over their smaller brethren. The study is expected to take about a year to complete. ''I like Tim personally,'' Mr. Brown said of Mr. Geithner. ''But he was better at putting out the fire than preventing the next one.''ECONOMIC growth remained sluggish and politics often intruded on the markets, yet stocks achieved solid returns last year all the same. It wasn't the first time that investors scaled a wall of worry, but it might be the only instance when the main source of concern, at least in the fourth quarter, was thought to be a cliff. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.4 percent for the year, even with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter. In those last months, doubts rose about whether Congress and President Obama could reach an agreement on taxes and spending in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff -- and the recession that was thought to lie below. The drama in Washington was one of several throughout the year that kept investors focused more on capitols than corporate boardrooms. European leaders were continually devising plans to rescue the euro and some of the economies that use it, and China underwent a change of leadership. Although the fourth-quarter loss was worse soon after Election Day and stocks raced ahead at the start of the new year, investors' concerns may yet prove well founded. The immediate concerns related to taxes were resolved only at the 11th hour -- just past midnight, really -- and much remains to be sorted out on spending. Investment advisers said that politics, at home and abroad, would continue to guide markets. ''The political environment and uncertainty revolving around policy decisions has been a really big factor,'' said Jeremy DeGroot, chief investment officer of the fund provider Litman Gregory. ''There are significant deficit issues that developed economies are facing, and the markets are hanging on every development.'' One bit of uncertainty was eliminated on Jan. 1, when Congress agreed to limit the scope of scheduled tax increases, although the deal still resulted in higher tax rates on payrolls, dividends and capital gains. Worries also abated when European Union finance ministers agreed in the fourth quarter to place big banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank. That followed the bank's announcement that it would support the bond markets of weaker economies, which are concentrated along the region's southern periphery. THE moves on both sides of the Atlantic helped stock funds achieve modest fourth-quarter gains. The average domestic fund in Morningstar's database rose 0.9 percent. International funds fared better, up 4.8 percent, on average, with portfolios that focus on European stocks returning 7.4 percent and emerging-market funds rising 6.2 percent. Full-year returns exceeded 14 percent for all four categories. Yields on short- and long-term debt remained low all year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintained the easy monetary policies in force since the 2008 crisis. While that could account for much of stocks' strength during 2012, the influence on bond returns, at least on high-quality government issues, may be waning. The average bond fund rose a healthy 8.4 percent on the year, but the fourth-quarter gain was a slim 1.3 percent, dragged lower by a 1.1 percent loss for portfolios of long-term government bonds. High-yield bond funds rose 3.1 percent for the quarter, on average, and funds that specialize in debt issued in emerging economies gained 3.9 percent. Just how helpful low interest rates were for economic growth is hard to discern. American economic output has continued to expand at a sluggish pace. And Europe is widely seen to be in recession. ''The trend of deterioration in Europe is not slowing down,'' said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroder Investment Management. She noted, though, that some indicators suggested that conditions were stabilizing at very low levels along the continent's troubled southern fringe. Whatever the economic impact of low interest rates, they seem to be helping corporate America. Corporate debt issuance last year exceeded $1 trillion for the first time. Increased indebtedness provides leverage that lifts profit margins, said Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO. Margins have reached record levels as a proportion of economic output and are ''weirdly high,'' in his opinion, ''unless we're in one of those wonderful secular shifts that people talk about but almost never see.'' He doesn't glimpse any such new normal, however, and cites high margins as a reason to be cautious about most stocks. Rising debt of another kind is a pressing concern for many investors. With the national debt above $16 trillion, the second part of the fiscal cliff debate, focusing on spending cuts, is expected to be played out over the next month or so in Washington. This could have higher stakes for the economy and markets and cause more acrimony than the haggling over tax rates. That's because the debt ceiling -- the limit imposed by Congress on the government's borrowing authority -- has been reached again. The concern is that Republicans will withhold approval to raise the ceiling without meaningful spending cuts. A similar battle in 2011 led to a downgrade of Treasury debt and was the catalyst for a violent stock market decline. ''We know there's going to be another fight around the debt ceiling in February,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. ''We avoided plummeting off the cliff, but we haven't avoided more cliffs in the future.'' THE immediate outlook for financial markets depends on how the next cliff is navigated. An overhaul of programs like Social Security and Medicare, combined with a revamping of the tax code in a so-called grand bargain, would set spending on a gentler slope for the long term without abrupt cuts now, investment advisers said. But some, like Mr. DeGroot, were not holding their breath. ''We have to have a credible medium- to long-term plan to bring down the excess of spending over revenues, but politicians are usually not ones to make those tough decisions until they're forced to,'' he said. ''It usually takes a market disruption to force their hand. Kicking the can is an easier, less painful approach. At some point, do investors say they don't see a resolution to this?'' Mr. DeGroot finds little to recommend to investors, though he does see opportunity in foreign stocks, particularly in emerging economies. Better still, he said, are so-called unconstrained bond funds whose managers have great flexibility in how they invest. Mr. Grantham also finds emerging stock markets appealing, along with Japan and ''cheap European value stocks,'' and he advises longer-term investors to consider commodity and energy stocks. As for the United States, he judges the market overvalued and recommends only high-quality companies. Sometimes, all it takes to do better is to avoid doing worse. Ms. Maisonneuve said investors in Europe, for example, had begun to recognize that if the region ''is leaving behind its near-death experience, then equity valuations are very attractive, compared to fixed income.'' A recovery in Chinese and American growth could help Europe ''continue to heal itself,'' she added. As for sectors, she particularly favors global health care, which can profit from drug sales to emerging economies, and cyclical industrial companies and commodity providers that would benefit from resurgent Chinese growth. She also likes financial service companies but is avoiding European banks. Investors fixated last year on so-called tail risks, or potential negative surprises. But what if 2013 offered some head risks? Such positive surprises wouldn't faze Francis Scotland, director of global macro research at Brandywine Global. ''I think people are looking in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Scotland said. ''There is a risk that something might actually go right. I think we're in a sweet spot. Let's assume we take most of the sting out of the fiscal cliff. Just the clarity will improve the corporate sector outlook. There's a real case for the economy to grow above trend in the first half. It's time to move to a more risk-oriented strategy.'' While he is happy to advocate for the American economy and likes domestic market sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, Mr. Scotland prefers to take risks elsewhere. He recommends bonds in peripheral European countries like Italy and Ireland; investment-grade emerging bond markets like Mexico, Poland and South Africa; and Japanese, Chinese and European stocks. ''You could make a case for all of these markets doing well, relative to the U.S.,'' he said. MR. LEVKOVICH makes the case for American stocks doing well. He says he expects the S. &P. 500 to rise 13 percent this year, to 1,615. He agrees with Mr. Scotland that ''there's a bunch of good news out there.'' ''Housing has improved, and job trends should improve based on surveys and credit growth,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''There's an energy boom in places like Montana and South Dakota that is growing more jobs, and manufacturing competitiveness is developing in this country; it's cheaper to build a plant and produce goods in South Carolina than in Shenzhen.'' Even though he is hopeful about 2013, Mr. Levkovich acknowledged that investors might want to wait until Washington produced a deal that averts the next fiscal cliff before they focus on the more pleasant landscape beyond it. ''We've got this positive dynamic,'' he said. ''The biggest constraint we're facing is the fiscal issue and dysfunctional government.''TWO market veterans have new books out, offering thoughts about how to invest. But their suggestions come with a twist. Instead of telling you what to buy and when, Ken Fisher, who runs Fisher Investments, a large money management firm, and Barton M. Biggs, the former Morgan Stanley partner and hedge fund manager who died before his book was published, mainly provide ideas to consider before you even think about placing your money. Let's begin with Mr. Fisher. He makes two very solid points in ''Plan Your Prosperity'' (Wiley, $26.95), which he wrote with Lara Hoffmans. First, Mr. Fisher writes, ''many investors and even some professionals distinguish between financial planning and retirement planning like they're two distinct phases, or the two are inherently radically different.'' That, he says, is wrong. Your approach -- save as much as you can, invest wisely, and so on -- should always be the same. It's just that your time horizon, and therefore the investments you choose, will vary depending on whether you are saving for a long-term goal like retirement or a near-term goal like buying a house or paying for college. Second, he argues that your investing should be ''benchmark'' driven. Here is how this could work -- and the example is ours, not his: You decide how much you want to make on your money -- say, 8 percent -- and what kind of investments you are comfortable with. We will assume that it's a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. Then you find an appropriate measuring stick. For this example, you would use a balanced index -- 60 percent of which tracked a broad stock market index like the Wilshire 5000, and 40 percent of which mirrored a broad bond index like the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate. Then you would either buy a mutual fund, like the Vanguard Balanced Index fund, designed to match the benchmark, or build a portfolio on your own that mimicked it. The fact that we had to create an example underscores a flaw with the book: it is very short on specifics. And that is by design. Mr. Fisher says up front that he is not going to offer benchmark or asset-allocation recommendations. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to make explicit suggestions without knowing your specific hopes and circumstances. One size, he says, does not fit all. That's fair enough. But detailed -- if only hypothetical -- examples of how to put his advice into practice would have been helpful. It makes sense that your investing approach should be all of one piece, but how exactly do you save for a house you want to buy within five years while still investing for your retirement, which could be decades away? True, there is no single answer. But laying out a series of possible routes would allow readers to make an educated choice. The lack of specifics is particularly frustrating for two reasons. First, the subtitle says that this is ''the only retirement guide you'll ever need, starting now -- whether you're 22, 52 or 82.'' It's not, unless you're an extremely experienced investor, in which case you don't need the book anyway. Second, when you read Mr. Fisher's biography on the book jacket, which notes that he has written a Forbes column for 28 years and is ranked No. 764 on the Forbes World's Billionaires list, you may be expecting more in the way of ''how to's'' from what he has learned along the way. The big ideas are fine, but you are left wanting more. YOU probably won't have that reaction to ''Diary of a Hedgehog'' (Wiley, $29.95), which is actually a diary from the last few years of Mr. Biggs's life. My diary, if I kept one, would include things like: ''Jan. 5: Tuna fish salad for lunch. Too much celery.'' Mr. Biggs's contains entries like: ''The investment process is only half the battle. The other weighty component is struggling with yourself and immunizing yourself from the psychological effects of the swings in the market, career risk'' and the like. He also writes: ''We are all vulnerable in varying proportions to the deliberating and destructive consequences of these malignancies, and there are no easy answers.'' You can skip over the day-to-day details of what was going on in the markets from mid-2010 to early 2012, the period covered by the diary. (On the other hand, it is interesting to see that despite his stellar record as a stock picker -- Institutional Investor named Mr. Biggs to its All-America Research Team 10 times -- he agonized when his picks were down for extended periods.) The important parts are his comments, which often come as asides: ''Warren Buffett has said he prefers to get his emerging-market exposure through companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, etc. I prefer mine through more direct participation.'' Commodities are ''not an investment,'' he says. ''An investment by definition is either current income or a stream of future income. When you buy a commodity, you have to be assuming that you are going to be able to sell it at a higher price to someone else, because it has no income. Thus, it is not investing -- it is speculating.'' ''Sometimes twiddling your thumbs is the least malignant activity.'' ''I can seldom remember such overwhelming bearishness by the great wise men, professors and stock market soothsayers. My experience has been that it is almost always right to bet against them when the consensus is the largest and the loudest.'' And, he says sagely, as investors, we ''always have to be aware of our innate and very human tendency to be fighting the last war.'' The combined take-away from these two books underscores one of the oldest pieces of financial advice, which is often ignored: Think before you move your money into stocks, bonds or any other investment.MANAGEMENT CHANGES Citigroup announced a management reshuffle on Monday, appointing Jamie Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora co-presidents in the latest move to steer the sprawling bank toward greater profitability. Under the reorganization, Mr. Forese will take on Citi's institutional business and Mr. Medina-Mora will oversee the bank's consumer business and its operations in Mexico. The moves are the first management changes since an abrupt change at the top of the bank in October when the bank's board pushed out Vikram S. Pandit as chief executive and installed Michael L. Corbat, left. JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG NEW HOME Royal Bank of Canada announced on Monday that it had hired Mark Mahaney, 47, as a managing director covering Internet stocks, according to a news release from the bank. Citigroup dismissed Mr. Mahaney in October after regulators discovered that he had responded to a reporter's e-mail inquiry about the financial results of YouTube, a division of Google, without getting permission from the bank. PETER LATTMAN FILLING A GAP The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Monday that it had named Geoffrey F. Aronow general counsel, the agency's top legal post. The appointment fills an important gap in the S.E.C.'s roster. There have been a number of prominent departures in recent weeks, after the resignation of Mary L. Schapiro, left, as chairwoman in November. Mr. Aronow, a partner in the Washington office of Bingham McCutchen, was the head of enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the late 1990s. BEN PROTESS PUBLIC OFFERING A German property company owned by the Goldman Sachs investment fund Whitehall announced on Monday that it was planning an initial public offering of stock, one of the first new listings in Europe this year. The I.P.O. of LEG Immobilien, which specializes in residential property, is expected to raise up to 1 billion euros, or $1.3 billion. Shares in the company are expected to start trading in February, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. MARK SCOTT nytimes.com/dealbookLOS ANGELES -- Warner Brothers is doubling down on the J. K. Rowling business. The studio, whose blockbuster ''Harry Potter'' films have generated billions of dollars for the company, announced on Thursday that it had concluded a deal with Ms. Rowling that will include new movies, distribution rights to a television mini-series and new theme park attractions. Under the agreement, the studio said, Ms. Rowling, who wrote the ''Harry Potter'' books, will become a screenwriter for the first time, working on an adaptation of her ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,'' a book that extends the world of wizardry in the Potter series. In a statement, Warner said the movie would become the first in a planned series of films. The studio also said the agreement would permit new attractions and initiatives connected with its ''Harry Potter'' presence at the Universal Studios theme parks. In television, the deal makes Warner the global distributor of a BBC mini-series based on ''The Casual Vacancy,'' a Rowling novel that is aimed at adults. The mini-series is set for production next year, the studio said. The Rowling deal is a significant step for Kevin Tsujihara, who was recently named chief executive of Warner, after a long, internal competition for a post being vacated by Barry Meyer. The ''Harry Potter'' film series, which Warner started in 2001 with ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' has been a huge success for the company. The final film, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2,'' took in more than $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office after its release in 2011. Ms. Rowling, who has become almost as closely associated with the studio as with her own books, said Warner executives had proposed the idea of a film based on ''Fantastic Beasts,'' and she counterproposed that she should be the writer, though she has not previously written screenplays. ''As I considered Warner's proposal, an idea took shape that I couldn't dislodge,'' Ms. Rowling said in a statement. ''That is how I ended up pitching my own idea for a film to Warner Brothers.'' She said she envisioned the film as ''an extension of the wizarding world,'' but not a prequel or sequel to the ''Potter'' series. Ms. Rowling has broadened her writing since the final Harry Potter book was published in 2007. ''The Casual Vacancy,'' published last year, featured dark themes like drug addiction and domestic abuse. This summer, she provided the surprise of the publishing world when it was revealed that she was the author of the mystery novel ''The Cuckoo's Calling,'' which she wrote under the pseudonym Robert Galbreath.The stock market fell again on Thursday and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed below a crucial technical level after disappointing financial forecasts from eBay and other companies cast doubt on the market's recent strength. The S.& P. 500 ended below its 50-day moving average of 1,543.04 for the first time this year, giving more weight to analysts' concerns that the market's recent rally was losing momentum, particularly after two days of sharp declines this week. The Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 indexes both have closed below their 50-day averages this week, adding to the overall technical pressure on the market. Technology led the day's fall. Shares of eBay dropped 5.9 percent to $52.82, a day after the e-commerce company posted results and gave a disappointing earnings forecast for the second quarter. The S.& P. technology sector index lost 1.4 percent. Apple shares extended their slide from Wednesday, when the stock broke below $400 on an intraday basis for the first time since December 2011. The stock tumbled 2.7 percent to close at $392.05 on Thursday. The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's fear index, gained 6.4 percent to 17.56. The VIX, as it is known, is up roughly 46 percent for the week so far. It still remains well below its recent highs, but the gains could signal a change in the market trend. ''There's definitely technical damage,'' said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Asset Management. ''I think that the period we had that had volatility tamped way down has likely ended.'' Stocks have rallied for much of the year on expectations that the American economy would continue to strengthen and that the Federal Reserve would keep its economic stimulus in place. More recent data on the economy has been less upbeat. On Wednesday, reports showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled in April and that the index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of future economic activity, fell in March for the first time in seven months. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 81.45 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 14,537.14. The S.& P. 500 dropped 10.40 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,541.61. The Nasdaq composite index fell 38.31 points, or 1.20 percent, to 3,166.36. After the bell, a number of prominent technology companies reported their financial results, including I.B.M., whose shares fell 4.2 percent to $198.45 in after-hours trading after its earnings missed analysts' expectations. After hours, shares of Google rose 2 percent after it released first-quarter results. It closed at $765.91. Shares of Microsoft shot up 2.7 percent to $29.57 after posting its results. During Thursday's regular session, volume was roughly 7.05 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT. In comparison, the average daily closing volume is about 6.36 billion this year. Volume has been heavier on negative days this week, as many investors have anticipated a pullback for some time after stocks' strong run to start the year and moved quickly to take profits. The S.& P. 500's moving average was also the floor of the trading range during the last month, making 1,543 a crucial technical support, according to Richard Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson. Mr. Ross and other analysts noted that the S.& P. 500 had posted negative second quarters in the last three years. The S.& P. health care sector also experienced big declines, with the UnitedHealth Group down 3.8 percent at $59.69, after the insurer lowered its 2013 revenue outlook. Other decliners included Morgan Stanley, whose shares dropped 5.4 percent to $20.31 after the bank reported revenue from fixed-income and commodities trading fell sharply from a year earlier. Shares of Bank of America, which posted disappointing results on Wednesday, fell 2.2 percent to $11.44 on Thursday. The earnings of companies in the S.& P. 500 are expected to have risen 1.9 percent in the first quarter, up from the 1.5 percent estimate at the start of the month, based on actual results from 82 companies and estimates for the rest, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of companies that have reported, 72 percent have topped analysts' expectations for their earnings, but only 43.9 percent have exceeded revenue forecasts. In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield dipped to 1.69 percent, from 1.70 percent late Wednesday.A federal judge in New York has dealt a blow to the nascent business of reselling digital goods like music and e-books, ruling that a small company's secondary market for digital music infringes on the copyrights controlled by record companies. The company, ReDigi, opened an online platform in late 2011 that allowed people to upload and resell songs they had bought from online retailers like Apple's iTunes. ReDigi said its technology deleted the original file once a copy was put up for sale, but the major record labels were skeptical, and Capitol Records sued in early 2012. The case has been closely watched as a test of whether the first sale doctrine -- the legal principle that someone who owns a copy of a copyrighted work, like a book or album, is free to resell it -- can be applied to digital goods. In an order dated Saturday, Judge Richard J. Sullivan of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled that ReDigi was liable for copyright infringement, and seemed entirely unmoved by ReDigi's arguments. ''The first sale defense does not cover this any more than it covered the sale of cassette recordings of vinyl records in a bygone era,'' he wrote. In sometimes wry language -- one footnote mentions that ReDigi compared its system to the ''Star Trek'' transporter and ''Willy Wonka's teleportation device, Wonkavision'' -- Judge Sullivan ruled that ReDigi's system infringed on Capitol's reproduction rights because it transmitted an unauthorized copy of the file over the Internet. In a statement, ReDigi said it was ''disappointed'' by the ruling and would appeal it, but noted that the decision applied to its original technology, not its updated version, ReDigi 2.0. ''While ReDigi 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 may ultimately be deemed to comply with copyright law,'' the judge wrote, ''it is clear that ReDigi 1.0 does not.'' Damages for the infringement will be considered at a later date. Capitol Records did not respond to a request for comment. Although ReDigi is a small player in the world of digital media, the case has been watched for the effect it may have on two giants, Apple and Amazon, which have applied for patents for secondary digital markets but have not put them in place. In addition to record companies, book authors have spoken out against the idea of a digital secondary market, saying that the presence of a ''used'' but perfect digital copy of a book would cause prices to crash. Among those supporting reselling digital goods are libraries, because it could make more material publicly available. The decision came less than two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld the first sale doctrine in the case of Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, about a student who was importing and selling textbooks that he had bought at a lower price overseas. That case concerned different aspects of the rule, and legal experts said it did not apply strictly in the ReDigi case. But digital rights advocates worried the decision effectively banned an online secondary market. ''The decision was very one-sided,'' said Jason M. Schultz, an assistant clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. ''There needs to be some way to resell if we believe the Supreme Court that first sale is important.''SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics projected Tuesday a profit of $8.3 billion in the quarter that ended last month as demand picked up for the flat screens it makes for mobile devices, including those for products sold by Apple. The forecast could signal a run of five consecutive record quarters, but it may end in the January-to-March period because of weaker seasonal demand. But a strong line of new smartphones -- the biggest earner for Samsung, the South Korean giant -- and improving chip prices have eased concerns that earnings growth could slow this year. ''Investors are a bit concerned that Samsung's momentum may slow in the first half,'' said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. ''The smartphone market is unlikely to sustain its strong growth, as advanced markets are nearing saturation despite growth in emerging countries.'' Samsung has outpaced Apple -- its biggest rival and also its biggest customer -- with sales momentum bolstered by its Galaxy Note II phone-tablet hybrid in the fourth quarter. IPhone 5 sales were a little below expectations, analysts said. While Apple introduced just a single new smartphone last year globally, Samsung bombarded the market with 37 variants adjusted to regional and consumer tastes, including both high-end and low-end smartphone models. By comparison, HTC of Taiwan released 18 models, Nokia of Finland released nine and LG Electronics of South Korea introduced 24. HTC said Monday that its fourth-quarter profit had slumped about 90 percent as its sales had continued to trail those of the Galaxy range of phones and the iPhone. Samsung gave its October-December earnings guidance before the full earnings release expected by Jan. 25. Shipments of Samsung's flagship phone, the Galaxy S III, which overtook the iPhone 4S in the third quarter to become the world's best-selling smartphone, are likely to have slipped to about 15 million in the past quarter from 18 million in July to September, analysts estimate, but sales of about 8 million of the Galaxy Note II should more than make up for that, pushing overall smartphone shipments to about 63 million. ''The Note was selling well, boosting fourth-quarter profit, while iPhone 5 sales were less than expected,'' said Song Myung-sub, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. ''Samsung's profit will drop in the current quarter because of decreased phone profits. It will launch the Galaxy S IV only in March or April, so, without new models, phone sales prices will fall this quarter. For the whole year, Samsung will launch new models faster than Apple and have the upper hand in the smartphone market.'' The new Galaxy, widely expected to be released within months, may have an unbreakable screen and full high-definition resolution, with 440 pixels per inch, as well as a better camera and a more powerful processor. ''Samsung's smartphone shipments are likely to grow, even in a seasonally weak first quarter,'' said Peter Yu, a BNP Paribas Securities analyst. ''The early launch of the Galaxy S IV would drive second-quarter growth momentum.'' He predicted Samsung's 2013 operating profit would grow 25 percent to almost $35 billion. Samsung is expected to increase its smartphone sales by more than a third this year, and widen its lead over Apple as it offers a broader range of mobile devices, said Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, a market researcher, which forecasts Samsung will sell 290 million smartphones this year, up from a projected 215 million in 2012. Apple is expected to sell 180 million iPhones, up from 135 million sold last year, Mr. Mawston said last week. Kim Sung-in, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities, said he expected Samsung to ship 320 million smartphones this year and double sales of its tablets to 32 million. Samsung said its operating profit in October to December had jumped 89 percent to 8.8 trillion won, or about $8.3 billion, from a year ago, just higher than an average forecast of 8.7 trillion won by 16 analysts surveyed by Reuters. That is 8.6 percent higher than its previous record of 8.1 trillion won in July to September. Analysts expect profits from the mobile division will more than double from last year and increase slightly from the previous quarter, to about 5.8 trillion won. A recovery in chip prices and flat screens should also bolster earnings, helped by booming sales of mobiles carrying Samsung's chips, microprocessors and flat screens.A new study of the nutritional quality of meals for children on the menus of the nation's largest chain restaurants has found that 91 percent do not even meet the standards set by the National Restaurant Association's Kids LiveWell program. An even larger percentage -- 97 percent of restaurant children's meals -- failed to meet stricter standards developed by a panel of nutrition and health experts for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the nonprofit research and advocacy group that commissioned the study. ''These were pretty dismal results,'' said Margo G. Wootan, its director of nutrition policy. The center did a similar study in 2008, which found that 99 percent of restaurant meals offered for children did not meet the standards. Ms. Wootan said she had expected a more significant improvement, particularly since many restaurant chains have been promoting their healthier options for youngsters. ''It's one thing if they had gone from 99 percent unhealthy to 50-50,'' she said. ''But to go from 1 percent of kids' meals being healthy to 3 percent over four years -- it's as if the restaurant industry hasn't heard there is an obesity epidemic in this country.'' The center singled out Subway as the only restaurant that did not offer sugared drinks with its children's meals, instead suggesting water or low-fat milk. All eight of the sandwich chain's Fresh Fit for Kids meal combinations met the nutritional criteria. At the other extreme were meals like grilled cheese on sourdough bread accompanied by fries and 2 percent chocolate milk at Applebee's. The meal contained 1,210 calories, almost half of which came from fat, or almost three times the amount of calories as the center's criteria for 4- to 8-year-olds allowed. In a statement, DineEquity, the parent company of Applebee's, said its children's menu offered other choices that were ''significantly'' lower in calories, fat and sodium, like a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of steamed broccoli and apple or grape juice, which contains 355 calories. ''We know Applebee's best serves our guests by providing a wide selection of dishes, and we'll continue to do so by expanding the number of options for kids by the end of this year,'' the company said. Applebee's is one of 120 restaurant chains that participate in the National Restaurant Association's Kids LiveWell program, which requires that at least one children's meal have two servings of fruits or vegetables, whole grains and a low-fat dairy product and be under 600 calories. There are 342 meal options that meet the criteria among the first 19 chains that signed onto the program, the association says. Anita Jones-Mueller, a registered dietitian and founder of the Web site Healthy Dining Finder, which works with the association to design and monitor the program, said many of the restaurant companies that support the site were working hard to improve the nutritional quality of the meals they offered children.The stock market was pummeled on Thursday after two big companies issued grim sales forecasts and economic data added to investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve would soon start winding down its economic stimulus program. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 225 points, its worst day in nearly two months. Investors also sold off bonds, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its highest level in more than two years. Before the start of trading, Wal-Mart Stores cut its estimates for annual revenue and profit, warning that cautious shoppers are spending less. The news followed a disappointing revenue forecast from Cisco Systems late on Wednesday. In a twist, more signs of resilience in the nation's economy weighed on the stock market. Reports on inflation and the job market appeared to raise the odds that the Fed would begin winding down its $85 billion monthly program of buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as early as next month. Many investors think that the Fed's effort to keep interest rates extremely low has underpinned the stock market's record run. ''People are worried that this move up in interest rates will kill the recovery, and we won't see the anticipated second-half improvement in growth and corporate earnings,'' said Alec Young, global equity strategist at S.& P. Capital IQ. The Dow industrials lost 225.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 15,112.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.07 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,661.32. The selling swept across all 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 63.16 points, or 1.7 percent, to 3,606.12. ''It seems like an overreaction today,'' said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Mr. Frederick said many investors were speculating that the improving economy meant that the Fed would start pumping less money into the financial system in the coming months. If that results in lower bond prices and even higher yields, it could lead more investors to dump dividend-paying stocks in favor of bonds. ''Some of the stocks getting hit hardest recently are big companies paying dividends,'' Mr. Frederick said. Utilities stocks are down 3 percent this week, for example, the worst of the S.& P. 500's industry groups. The government said on Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dropped to 320,000 last week, the lowest level since October 2007, two months before the start of the recession. A slowly improving economy should eventually lead to higher spending and more sales for big companies. But right now, investors are more focused on the Fed's next move, said Natalie Trunow, the chief investment officer at Calvert Investments. ''There's this counterintuitive reaction to economic news,'' Ms. Trunow said. ''Positive data comes out and markets aren't excited about it. They say, 'Uh-oh, the stimulus will be removed.' '' Wal-Mart fell $1.99, or 3 percent, to $74.41 after the company cut its profit and revenue forecasts for 2013. It also reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates. Shares of Cisco Systems fell $1.89, or 7 percent, to $24.49, for the biggest drop of the 30 big companies in the Dow, after the company announced plans late on Wednesday to cut 5 percent of its work force, roughly 4,000 employees, as its sales slow. Cisco's announcement led to selling in other technology stocks, as it is widely regarded as a bellwether for the entire industry. That is because the company sells a wide range of products to corporations and governments and its fiscal quarters end a month later than most major technology companies', which gives investors an early look into current conditions. The Dow has slumped 2 percent so far this week, and the S.& P. 500 is down 1.8 percent. However, the Dow is up 15.3 percent for the year so far, while the S.& P. 500 is up 16.5 percent. Both indexes closed at nominal highs on Aug. 2. In the bond market, interest rates climbed, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for interest rates on mortgage loans, jumped as high as 2.81 percent in early trading. The selling in the 10-year note eased a bit later in the day and its price ended down 15/32, to 97 22/32, giving it a yield of 2.77 percent, up from 2.71 percent late on Wednesday. Higher long-term interest rates could cool housing sales. ''A sharp increase in long-term rates translates into a sharp increase in mortgage rates,'' Ms. Trunow said. ''That's bound to impact the housing market.''TOKYO -- Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by sales, lifted its annual profit forecast on Friday after almost doubling its net income in the quarter that ended in June to 562.1 billion yen ($5.64 billion) from a year earlier, thanks to favorable exchange rates. Profit in the Japanese automaker's financial first quarter beat analysts' expectations by a wide margin, and underscored the boost that Toyota and other automakers have received from the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Those policies have galvanized Japan's export industry by weakening the yen by about 15 percent since last year, increasing the value of products sold overseas. Technically, Toyota sold almost 37,000 fewer vehicles in the latest quarter, compared with the same quarter last year, with sales falling in Europe, Asia and Japan. Sales in Japan have slowed since government incentives for fuel-efficient cars expired last year. Toyota is also struggling in China, the world's biggest auto market, because consumer enmity over a territorial spat between Beijing and Tokyo has weighed on sales of Japanese brands. Auto sales continue to slump across the board in Europe. But it was the weaker yen, together with a strong showing in its biggest overseas market, the United States, that lifted Toyota's bottom line. Economists predict the yen to weaken further, while the latest United States sales figures, for July, showed Toyota surging ahead of Ford for the first time in three years, with a 17 percent jump from the same month last year. Toyota now expects net income for its full financial year that ends next March to reach 1.48 trillion yen, up slightly from a previous forecast of 1.37 trillion yen and an increase of 54 percent from its net profit last year. In the latest quarter, net profit rose 93.6 percent from a year earlier to 562.1 billion yen, while operating profit rose 87.9 percent to 663.3 billion yen. Toyota attributed more than four-fifths of its operating profit increase to the weaker yen. Net revenue for the quarter rose 13.7 percent to 6.255 trillion yen compared to last year. Helped by its strong numbers, Toyota is set to become the first automaker in the world to build more than 10 million vehicles in a single year. It said on Friday that it would build 10.12 million vehicles this calendar year, up 180,000 units from a previous production plan. Those numbers include models made by Daihatsu Motor and Hino Motors, which are part of the Toyota group.LOS ANGELES -- Comcast's NBCUniversal put a television executive in charge of its film studio on Monday, leading to the promotion of one longtime movie manager and the ouster of another. NBCUniversal said that the executive, Jeff Shell, a Comcast insider who has recently been focused on the media conglomerate's international businesses, will take over day-to-day operations at Universal Studios, which includes the Universal and Focus Features labels. For the last 18 years, those duties have fallen to Ron Meyer, who will step into a kind of senior statesman role across the company. By naming one of its own to succeed Mr. Meyer -- rather than promoting a Universal executive -- Comcast signaled that the movie studio is now firmly nested inside a corporate structure that cares as much about funneling content to cable video-on-demand services as it does about theatrical hits. Comcast has made multiple changes on the television side of NBCUniversal, but it has largely left the film and theme park unit alone, leading to speculation about its future. ''I have worked with him for over a decade and have been consistently impressed by his strategic vision, operational focus and energy,'' Steve Burke, NBCUniversal's chief executive, said of Mr. Shell in a statement. Adam Fogelson, the chairman of Universal Pictures, will leave the company after 15 years. A former movie marketer, Mr. Fogelson found hits in films like ''Fast & Furious 6,'' ''Despicable Me 2'' and ''Ted'' -- notably leaving behind a long fallow period for the studio. But Mr. Fogelson was also behind flops like ''R.I.P.D.'' and ''Battleship.'' Coming up is ''47 Ronin,'' a samurai film that has suffered cost overruns. Mr. Fogelson's deputy, Donna Langley, will take over his job. ''She has been a driving force behind Universal's current successes,'' Mr. Burke said. Mr. Meyer, 68, the longest-serving chief of a major studio, will become the vice chairman of NBCUniversal, which Comcast bought in 2011. A consummate Hollywood player -- he co-founded Creative Artists Agency -- Mr. Meyer is known for leading Universal through disruptive ownership changes; the studio has been bought and sold at least four times in recent decades. Regime change has recently been sweeping Hollywood. Universal joins 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Brothers, all of which have undergone executive shuffling over the last year and a half, for various reasons. The continued presence of Mr. Meyer, who was signed to a contract that extends into 2017, is intended in part to ensure stability while Mr. Shell, 48, who is not known in film circles, gets up to speed. Mr. Shell helped manage overseas film distribution and marketing as chairman of NBCUniversal International, but he has largely spent his career in television. He previously ran Comcast's cable networks, which include E! and Style. Before joining Comcast, Mr. Shell was chief executive of TV Guide International. Earlier in his career, he logged time at News Corporation, where he helped oversee Fox Sports, FX and the National Geographic Channel.The stock market retreated from its nominal highs on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipping after five days of gains. Despite the pullback, the Dow Jones industrial average remained above the 15,000 mark, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was still well above 1,600. The length of the recent market rally has surprised some investors. Analysts said it was difficult for stocks to continue their upward momentum without further catalysts, such as first-quarter earnings reports, which are nearing an end. ''This market is so stretched to the upside that if we get some little wiggle somewhere, I can easily see us getting back down to 1,580'' on the S.& P. 500, said Stephen J. Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management. The Dow industrials fell 22.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 15,082.62. The S.& P. 500 declined 6.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,626.67. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 4.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,409.17. The day's main economic data was basically positive, but failed to give much of a boost to stocks. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than five years. New jobless claims fell by 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 323,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less-volatile figure, dropped 6,250, to 336,750. Apple helped lead the declines of both the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq, falling $4.02, or 0.9 percent, to $456.77. I.B.M. was the biggest drag on the Dow, dropping $1.58, or 0.8 percent, to $203.24. Despite the day's declines, the Dow is up 15.1 percent so far this year, while the S.& P. 500 is up 14.1 percent. Trading was fairly volatile. The market, which had been down slightly from the opening bell through midday, reversed course and began to edge higher in early afternoon. Stocks lost steam later in the session. Limiting the losses in the S.& P. 500, News Corporation shares rose $1.46, or 4.6 percent to $33.44 after it reported earnings late Wednesday that beat expectations. Among the stocks making big gains, Tesla Motors surged $13.61, or 24.4 percent, to $69.40 a day after posting earnings that were three times what analysts had expected, as the company sold more cars than initially forecast. Barnes & Noble shot up $4.31, or 24.3 percent, to $22.08, after TechCrunch, an influential technology Web site, published an unconfirmed report that Microsoft was considering an offer to acquire all of the company's Nook Media's digital assets for $1 billion. Microsoft fell 33 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.66. In the bond market, interest rates moved up. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 21/32, to 99 14/32, while its yield rose to 1.81 percent, from 1.77 percent late Wednesday.Stocks rose on Tuesday, led by the health care sector after the government said it would alter payment rates for private Medicare insurers, and helped by data on factory orders that indicated the economy was steadily improving. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at nominal highs, though the S.& P. fell short of breaking above its milestone intraday high of 1,576.09. The federal government dropped plans to cut payments for private Medicare Advantage insurers, and instead said it would allow a 3.3 percent raise. The news improved shares of some health insurers, including Humana, which derives about two-thirds of its revenue from the Medicare Advantage business. The stock jumped 5.5 percent to $79.11 and was among the biggest percentage gainers on the S.& P. 500. UnitedHealth Group gained 4.7 percent to $61.74. ''They didn't expect the result that they got. That will help with their bottom line,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, N.J. Strengthening economic data has helped stocks rally since the start of the year. On Tuesday, data showed February factory orders rose 3 percent, slightly above expectations. That follows a weak reading on manufacturing on Monday that sparked a pullback in stocks. The S.& P. 500-stock index is now up 10.1 percent since the start of the year. For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 89.16 points, or 0.61 percent, at 14,662.01. The S.& P. 500 was up 8.08 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,570.25. The Nasdaq composite index was up 15.69 points, or 0.48 percent, at 3,254.86. The S.& P. 500 surpassed its 2007 closing high last Thursday, while the Dow first broke above its 2007 record on March 5. Stocks pared gains late in the session, giving investors another reason to question the strength of the recent rally. ''The recent legs of this rally have lacked a bit of conviction,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ''What's been leading equity markets has been more defensive sectors.'' Health care sector stocks are still seen as cheap relative to the overall market. Humana, which has a market cap of about $11.9 billion, has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, below the S.& P. 500 P/E average ratio of about 16.5. UnitedHealth has a P/E ratio of 10.6 and Cigna, 9.7 ratio. ''We do think that health care stocks are a nice combination of dividend yields, growth and low valuations, and we are very constructive on the sector,'' said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. Other big gainers in the health care sector included Cigna, up 2.9 percent at $64.75. Moves are expected to be limited this week before Friday's employment report. The March jobs report could give clues on how successful the Federal Reserve has been in lowering unemployment, one of the primary headwinds for the economy. About 200,000 jobs were created last month, according to a Reuters poll, down from 236,000 in February. The unemployment rate is expected to come in at 7.7 percent, unchanged from the previous month, the poll showed. In an effort to bring down the unemployment rate, the Fed has maintained an accommodative monetary policy, which has also benefited stocks. Other gainers included Hertz Global Holdings shares, up 6.8 percent to $23.41, after the company forecast strong earnings and revenue through 2015 as a result of increasing global demand for car rentals and benefits from its recently completed acquisition of Dollar Thrifty. Among decliners, Delta Air Lines was off 8.1 percent at $14.94. Delta's unit revenue for March rose at a slower rate than in the prior two months. Shares of the Nasdaq OMX Group fell 12.8 percent to $27.91 after agreeing to buy a BGC Partners trading platform. BGC shares were up 48.6 percent at $5.72. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 5.2 percent to $22.10 after Goldman Sachs downgraded them to sell. Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 101 8/32 and the yield rose to 1.86 percent from 1.84 percent late Monday.PARIS -- Another French industry is in trouble. And once again the Socialist government of President François Hollande is sending mixed messages -- and renewing concerns elsewhere in Europe that France may be returning to old ways where industrial policy is concerned. On Friday, after more signs of financial stress at PSA Peugeot Citroën, Budget Minister Jérôme Cahuzac said the government was considering its options, including taking a stake in the carmaker through France's strategic investment fund. ''Let's be clear, the company cannot and must not disappear,'' he told RMC radio and BFM television. ''We have to do whatever is necessary to support it.'' But Mr. Cahuzac was later contradicted by officials who outrank him, including Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who said that Peugeot was not seeking aid, and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, who said that intervention along those lines ''is not on the agenda.'' Those hasty correctives may or may not assuage concerns elsewhere, but the issue is sensitive among Europe's industrial leaders. Any attempt to prop up Peugeot could strain France's relations with Germany, whose carmakers have not been hit nearly as hard by the downturn in the region's economy and auto market. And any helping hand from the Élysée Palace could provoke workers in Italy to call for similar actions to help Fiat, the country's largest employer, which is also under severe pressure. The officials made their comments after Peugeot, the biggest automaker in Europe after Volkswagen, said late Thursday that it would mark down the value of its car plants and other automotive assets by more than one-fourth -- by about &#x20ac;3.9 billion, or $5.2 billion -- to reflect ''the impact on the group of the deterioration of the European market.'' That charge, and an additional &#x20ac;243 million write-down for what the company called ''onerous'' contracts -- which include a supply deal with Iran -- will make a big dent in the bottom line when Peugeot reports its 2012 results Wednesday. But the company and government officials were at pains to note that the noncash charges would not affect its solvency. Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a PSA Peugeot Citroën spokesman, declined to comment Friday. Some of the problems facing Peugeot are shared by its competitors. The European Union's car market shrank 8 percent last year, to just over 12 million units, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, reducing demand for new cars to the lowest level since 1995. But Peugeot did worse than the Union's overall market, with deliveries falling 13 percent, hurt by its reliance on South European markets where the euro crisis and austerity hurt demand. Its profitability has suffered from its concentration on lower-price models with thinner profit margins, compared with Germany's automakers. As its woes have mounted, its market value has slipped to about &#x20ac;2.1 billion, compared with about &#x20ac;80 billion for Volkswagen. German automakers like Audi and Mercedes-Benz, as well as Volkswagen, have been able to compensate for weakness in Europe by selling cars in the United States, where Peugeot is not present. What is more, the German domestic market has remained relatively stable, falling only 3 percent last year, compared with the 14 percent drop in France. German automotive companies regard their success as the payoff for years of investment in foreign markets, and would clearly resent any of their European competitors' receiving government support. A spokesman for the German Association of the Automotive Industry declined on Friday to comment on Peugeot's situation. But he referred to a speech last week by the president of the group, Matthias Wissmann, who implicitly criticized state aid for weak carmakers. ''It would be better if everyone were to improve their own competitiveness,'' Mr. Wissmann said in Berlin. ''The principle must apply, also in Europe, that we orient ourselves on the strong, not on the weak.'' German manufacturers sold nearly 1.3 million cars in the United States last year, a 21 percent increase over 2011. Although Fiat has also begun a renewed push into the U.S. market, thanks to its control of Chrysler, right now the German automakers are the only European manufacturers with a strong presence there. Volvo Cars of Sweden also has a long tradition in the United States, but its sales of 68,000 vehicles last year were far behind the Germans. But German government support for its auto industry is not unheard of. In 2009, Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged &#x20ac;4.5 billion in aid to General Motors' Opel unit if it were sold to a components supplier, Magna. The money was never paid because G.M. backed out of the deal. In addition, the German state of Lower Saxony has long held 20 percent of the voting shares of Volkswagen, which has its headquarters there. The stake gives the state government effective veto power over major decisions. Still, in recent years Volkswagen, which is profitable, has subsidized the state rather than the other way around. The mixed message sent by officials in Paris on Friday echoed the situation last autumn during a protracted industrial dispute with the Luxembourg-based steel giant ArcelorMittal. The issue then was Arcelor's plans to close two blast furnaces in Florange, in eastern France. At one point in that face-off, Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg threatened to nationalize the entire Florange complex if the steel maker did not reverse its plans. But he made the threat even as the French government was trying to lure foreign investors through an advertising campaign with the tag line ''Say oui to France'' and otherwise trumpeting its efforts to increase France's industrial competitiveness. In the end, Mr. Montebourg was largely excluded from the final negotiations, and Arcelor was able to carry out its program essentially as planned, after some compromises that enabled the Hollande government to save face. After that politically bruising battle, Mr. Ayrault, the prime minister, sought in January to outline the government's industrial policy. He said the state would consider investing in companies when they were engaged in projects that, while not immediately profitable, could eventually yield major payoffs, or when the survival of a ''strategic'' enterprise was at stake. France has long considered the automotive sector, which directly employs more than 200,000 people, to be strategic. But, of course, so does the United States, which is why the Obama administration was willing to bail out General Motors and Chrysler in 2009. The French government, which holds a stake of about 15 percent in Renault, is already deeply involved with Peugeot. Last autumn, the state extended credit guarantees worth &#x20ac;7 billion to the company's finance unit, to ensure that customers could still get loans at competitive rates, despite the company's own deteriorating balance sheet. That move gave the government a seat on the Peugeot board and the right to review the company's operations. European competition authorities in Brussels, who are reviewing those guarantees, would scrutinize any additional support. Peugeot, meanwhile, sold a 7 percent stake last year to General Motors, which is struggling to turn around its own European unit, Adam Opel. Peugeot initially described the deal as a global alliance, but so far analysts have been underwhelmed by the loose affiliation, which is mainly about logistics and a few vehicle projects. Ian Fletcher, an analyst at IHS Automotive in London, said Peugeot needed to carry out its restructuring plans, which call for the closure of a plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, and a reduction of 11,200 jobs from its French work force of roughly 97,000. But it is not in dire need of government money, he said, because the company has built up enough of a cash nest egg that it could become profitable again, if it makes it through the restructuring and -- a big if -- the European market rebounds by early 2015. In the short term, an infusion of investment capital from the French government ''would be great'' for Peugeot, Mr. Fletcher said. But over the longer term, he added, ''it might create more problems than it solved.'' Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.ECONOMIC REPORTS Data scheduled to be released includes retail sales for December, the Producer Price Index for December, and business inventories for November (Tuesday); the Consumer Price Index for December, industrial production for December and the Federal Reserve beige book (Wednesday); weekly jobless claims, housing starts for December and the Philadelphia Fed index for January (Thursday); and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for January (Friday).

That word, opportunity, has been a shaper of my life. My family lived through the civil rights era, in which many Americans tried to right the wrongs of social injustice. My parents believed that things would change for minorities and that there would be opportunity for those who were ready. They stressed that my siblings and I get ready, through education. As a child in Ohio, I delivered The Dayton Daily News. At 13, I was named newspaper delivery boy of the year; my picture was on the front page. I later worked in the circulation department until I left for college. When I was a senior in high school, the General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, was diversifying. My counselor recommended that I attend G.M.I., but I told her I was interested in studying computer science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. My counselor went so far as to fill out a G.M.I. application and slip it into my locker. I signed it and sent it in just to have her leave me alone. Soon after, G.M.I. sent me an acceptance letter. Attending G.M.I. worked out well because I didn't know how I would pay for Miami, and the institute had a cooperative program in which I attended classes for six weeks, then worked for six weeks. After graduating in 1976, I worked at G.M. as a production engineer, making steering wheels. A year later, I became a front line supervisor. I loved the manufacturing floor and learning about different operations. A majority of my crew were women, who helped me learn the job. I learned that people want to help one another. You're responsible for a job, but you can't do it alone. One of my later assignments as production manager was to help turn around a G.M. operation in Portugal. It was a chance to make a difference and I seized it, yet I recall thinking as the plane took off for Lisbon, ''What have I done?'' But I loved the assignment. My family and I traveled extensively in Europe in the three years I was there. After returning from Portugal in 1987, I accepted my first executive assignment, as general superintendent of manufacturing in Canada. In 1991, I attended a Sloan executive program at Stanford for a master of science in management degree. In 1997, G.M. appointed me as vice president and general manager of Delphi interior and safety systems, a division of Delphi Automotive Systems, its parts maker. Two years later it spun off Delphi. When my colleagues and I were contemplating whether to move to the new company, I said, ''Let's go for it.'' I've always loved a good journey. I was promoted twice more before becoming president and chief operating officer in 2005. . That was the same year we filed for Chapter 11 reorganization because our performance was continuing to deteriorate. We needed to preserve the value of the company before it deteriorated any further. In 2007, I was named Delphi's C.E.O. and remained president as well. The reorganization was one of the largest in the nation's industrial history. We focused our portfolio on 33 core product lines, down from 131, and emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 as a leaner, more product-focused, high-tech company. We had taken a formerly unprofitable subsidiary, geared to one North American customer, and made it a diversified growth company with over 100,000 employees in over 30 countries. Even though I've been at G.M. and Delphi my entire career, it feels as if I've been at several companies because I've worked in so many areas. My career is an example of taking advantage of opportunities when they come along. In November 2011, I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark Delphi's initial public offering. I remember standing there thinking that we had seized our opportunity.DETROIT -- Sales of new vehicles rose modestly in February, as American consumers continued to buy more fuel-efficient cars, and businesses, benefiting from increased home construction, replaced aging pickup trucks with newer models. Automakers sold 1.19 million vehicles during the month, a 3.7 percent increase over the period a year earlier, according to the research firm Autodata. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate, a closely watched market indicator, totaled about 15.4 million vehicles. The rate bodes well for the industry, as automakers increase production to meet demand for their new products. The February results were a bit lower than anticipated, analysts said, attributing part of the slowdown during the latter part of the month to rising gas prices and fluctuations in the stock market. ''Whenever there is uncertainty in the stock market, the car market doesn't like it,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the automotive research site TrueCar.com. ''But despite lower stocks and higher gas prices, consumers continued to buy.'' The two largest Detroit car companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, posted some of the best results among all the major automakers. G.M. said it sold 224,000 vehicles in February, a 7.2 percent increase from the same month in 2012. All of G.M.'s domestic brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick -- had higher year-over-year sales. Cadillac led the way with a 20 percent gain, primarily because of healthy sales of the new ATS compact sedan. G.M. also reported increases in sales of its newest small cars, like the Buick Verano and the Chevrolet Spark. But its most prominent gains were in pickup trucks. The company said sales of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup rose 29 percent, and the GMC Sierra increased 25 percent. Executives attributed the performance to a surge in housing starts and the need for construction companies to replace older pickups. ''A significant tail wind for our industry is new home construction, which is creating jobs and fueling the demand for pickups,'' said Kurt McNeil, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations. Ford said it sold 195,000 vehicles during the month, which represents a 9.3 percent gain from a year ago. Much of Ford's gains came from sales of sport utility vehicles like the Escape and Explorer. The company's redesigned midsize sedan, the Fusion, also had a good month, with a 28 percent improvement over last year. And like G.M., Ford also benefited from higher demand for pickups. Ford said that it sold 54,000 F-series trucks during the month, a 15.3 percent increase from February 2012. But Ford is still struggling to invigorate its lagging Lincoln luxury brand, which dropped 29 percent in sales. ''Lincoln's performance was dismal,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research site Edmunds.com. The growth rate at Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit automakers, slowed somewhat after several months of recording double-digit increases. The company said that it sold 139,000 vehicles in February, a 4.1 percent improvement over a year earlier. That is a smaller increase than Chrysler has reported in previous months. ''In spite of a cautious ramp up of some of our most popular products, which limited inventory last month, we still managed to record our strongest February in five years,'' said Reid Bigland, head of United States sales for Chrysler. Chrysler's best performers during the month were passenger cars like the new Dodge Dart. Sales of its Ram pickup increased 3 percent, while sales of its Jeep sport utility vehicles dropped 16 percent. The big Japanese automakers had mixed results, as they continued their methodical comeback from inventory disruptions because of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan two years ago. Toyota, the largest Japanese car manufacturer, said it sold 166,000 vehicles in February, about 4.3 percent more than a year earlier. Usually, Toyota's passenger cars are its hottest sellers and its trucks trail the market. But in February the roles were reversed, as its car sales dropped about 3 percent and its sport utility vehicles and truck sales increased by 16 percent. Honda reported a 2 percent drop in sales, to 107,000 vehicles. The company said heavy winter storms in the Northeast, traditionally one of its strongest regions, contributed to the decline. And Nissan said its February sales slid about 6.6 percent, to 99,000 vehicles. February was a relatively good month for Volkswagen, the big German automaker, which is rapidly expanding its United States operations. V.W. said it sold 42,000 vehicles during the month, an 8.4 percent increase from the previous year. The results were fueled primarily by strong sales of its Audi luxury-brand vehicles, which rose about 28 percent.PARIS -- Renault said on Thursday that Carlos Tavares, the automaker's chief operating officer and long considered a possible successor to the chief executive, was stepping down. His departure, which Renault said had been ''mutually agreed,'' came two weeks after an interview with Bloomberg News in which he suggested that Carlos Ghosn, the chief, was not going anywhere soon. ''We have a big leader and he is here to stay,'' Mr. Tavares said. ''Anyone who is passionate about the auto industry comes to a conclusion that there is a point where you have the energy and appetite for a No. 1 position,'' he said. ''My experience would be good for any car company,'' Bloomberg News quoted Mr. Tavares as saying. ''Why not G.M.? I would be honored to lead a company like G.M.'' A Renault spokeswoman, Rie Yamane, would say only that Mr. Tavares was leaving ''in order to pursue other personal projects.'' Mr. Ghosn, 59, will temporarily take over the functions of chief operating officer, Renault said. Ms. Yamane said that the Renault board would meet soon to decide how to proceed, but that no date had been set for a meeting. A spokesman for Mr. Tavares said he would not be available for comment. Mr. Tavares, 55 and a native of Portugal, has been credited with turning around Renault's Japanese partner, Nissan Motor, but he is leaving at a time when the company, based in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris, is struggling because of a prolonged slump in the European car market. Both General Motors and Ford are due for a changing of the guard soon. The G.M. boss, Daniel F. Akerson, is 64, while Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, is 68. Ford and General Motors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition that he not be named because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said Mr. Tavares would not be going to General Motors. According to his Renault biography, Mr. Tavares, who had served in the No. 2 job since July 2011, is a highly skilled racing driver. He studied engineering at the elite École Centrale in Paris before joining Renault as a test-driving engineer in 1981. He moved steadily up the ranks, spending significant time abroad working for Nissan in the United States and Japan. With or without Mr. Tavares, Renault is facing a tough environment in Europe. The European Union passenger car market shrank by 6.6 percent in the first six months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, to 6.2 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said in July. Sales at Renault, which is second to PSA Peugeot Citroën in sales by French automakers, fell 4.5 percent, to 545,000 units.LOS ANGELES -- A day after she was elected president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Cheryl Boone Isaacs said her first order of business was to check in on the organization's most valuable asset: the Oscars. ''I have a meeting with the producers later today, in fact,'' Ms. Isaacs said. Speaking briefly by telephone on Wednesday, Ms. Isaacs, who succeeded Hawk Koch, said she was generally happy with this year's show, which attracted strong ratings but was also criticized for the crude humor of its host, Seth MacFarlane. And she said she had supported Mr. Koch's decision to bring back last year's producers, Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, though the choice of producers has customarily been left to the incoming president. Still, Ms. Isaacs said she anticipated changes. ''Right off the bat, it will not be the same show,'' she said. Ms. Isaacs, who was elected at a Tuesday night meeting of the group's governing board, is the first woman to hold the post since Fay Kanin, from 1979 to 1983, and is the first African-American president in the group's 86-year history. A consummate academy insider, Ms. Isaacs has been part of the group's board of governors for more than 20 years. She has worked recently as an independent marketing consultant, following an executive career at New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures. Ms. Isaacs and Robert G. Friedman, the co-chairman of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group, were regarded by fellow governors and other academy insiders to be leading prospects for the presidency. One of Ms. Isaacs's early tasks will be to oversee a renewal of deals with Dawn Hudson, the academy's chief executive, and Ric Robertson, its chief operating officer, whose three-year contracts are set to expire next year. Ms. Isaacs also said she expected the academy to break ground next year on its planned movie museum in Los Angeles. In filling other positions on Tuesday, the governors elected John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studio, as first vice president, while electing the writer-director Phil Robinson as secretary and Richard W. Cook, a film entrepreneur and former Disney executive, as treasurer. Jeffrey Kurland, a costume designer, and Leonard Engelman, a makeup artist, were also elected as vice-presidents. Also at their Tuesday meeting, the academy's governors added a 17th branch, for casting directors, to the group's existing divisions, which represent various groups of film professionals, including actors, directors, film editors and sound artists. A number of casting directors had previously been admitted to the approximately 6,000-member associations as members-at-large.DETROIT -- Daniel Akerson, General Motors' chief executive, stood before a packed hall and took a victory lap of sorts at the company's annual meeting here on Thursday, celebrating a new level of financial stability and G.M.'s return to the ranks of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But despite its comeback from bankruptcy and a $49.5-billion government bailout, G.M., the nation's biggest automaker, is still grappling with its core mission: how to win new customers with better cars and trucks. After the meeting, Mr. Akerson conceded that the company's resurgence would not be complete until it delivered fully on its promise to build world-class vehicles. ''As far as we have come, we've got many, many miles to go to achieve the heights and goals we set out for ourselves,'' Mr. Akerson said at a news conference. In its showrooms, the results have been lackluster. G.M. has not gained any appreciable market share in the United States for years, and its newest products have been a mixed bag. So far this year, G.M. has an 18 percent share, compared with 17.8 percent for the same period in 2012. Even as it grows in places like China, G.M. lags rivals like the Ford Motor Company in generating profits in North America. All of which puts Mr. Akerson, and his company, under pressure to deliver. ''This is no time for Akerson to stand on the aircraft carrier and declare the mission accomplished,'' said Jim Hall, managing director of the auto consulting firm 2953 Analytics. Since emerging from G.M.'s government-selected board to become chief executive three years ago, Mr. Akerson has recast the company's management team and instilled a heightened sense of urgency and accountability. But turning G.M. into a growth company in the fiercely competitive auto industry is proving to be a lot tougher. Analysts say G.M. trails Ford and other automakers in globalizing vehicle platforms to save development costs, and has yet to produce expressive designs that consistently lure new customers into its showrooms. ''The new blood is still doing some of the same old G.M. stuff on the product side,'' Mr. Hall said. G.M. has had success with totally new products, like its Cadillac ATS sedan and Buick Encore sport utility vehicle. But revamped versions of bellwether Chevrolet models like the Malibu and Impala have fallen flat. The company announced last week that it would make several changes to the Malibu in an effort to bolster sales. The car was among several models that were delayed or starved for financing during the company's bankruptcy in 2009. ''Product programs were delayed and shifted and moved during that volatile period,'' said Matthew Stover, an analyst at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners. ''But going forward, G.M. is on the hook and has to do better.'' Mr. Akerson prefers to attribute many of G.M.'s problems to its past habits, when he said the company lacked organizational discipline and too often overproduced vehicles that did not sell. ''You don't correct all of the systemic problems of a company that went through bankruptcy in 39 days of bankruptcy,'' he said. Yet G.M. also received an enormous amount of help from American taxpayers, which allowed the company to reinvent itself as a smaller, leaner organization with fewer brands, dealers and workers. Given the help, analysts say, it's no surprise G.M. has become profitable again. The bailout did come with a cost -- a moniker of ''Government Motors,'' which caused an untold number of consumers to avoid its products. But the lingering taint is also wearing off. The government's ownership of G.M. stock -- once as high as 60 percent -- has dropped to about 14 percent since the Treasury Department began selling off its remaining shares last year. ''The Government Motors problem has run its course,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an executive at the firm AutoTrends Consulting. ''Now it's all about competing with other car companies like Ford and Toyota and Hyundai who are at the top of their game.'' So far this year, G.M. sales in the United States have grown by 8 percent, which is slightly more than the overall industry. The company is expecting another lift when its new pickup trucks begin arriving in dealerships this summer. G.M. is hoping that a maintenance program announced on Thursday will also add some luster. The company said it would offer two years of free oil changes, tire rotations and vehicle inspections to any customer who buys or leases a new Chevrolet, Buick or GMC model. ''We know that customers who service their vehicles at our dealerships are much more likely to purchase another G.M. product down the road,'' Mr. Akerson said. Analysts said the move was a bit of a stopgap until G.M. could deliver significantly improved cars and trucks. ''It still comes down to product,'' said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst at the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. Mr. Akerson, 64, is expected to continue as G.M.'s chief executive and chairman for another year or two. Known inside the company as a taskmaster, he promised shareholders that he would continue management's ''relentless drive to transform G.M.'' And with its bankruptcy and bailout fading, there are no excuses left for subpar cars like the Malibu, analysts said. ''They have got everything they need to succeed,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Now they have to make it work.''A judge has rejected a proposed severance package of nearly $20 million for Thomas W. Horton, the chairman and chief executive of the AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, saying that the payout was not allowed under federal bankruptcy law. Judge Sean H. Lane of United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan issued his decision on the severance package on Thursday. During a hearing on March 27, Judge Lane approved AMR's planned $11 billion merger with US Airways. Mr. Horton's $19.9 million severance had been part of the merger agreement and was to consist of equal amounts of cash and shares of the combined company. Judge Lane suggested at the March hearing that the severance might be better addressed in AMR's reorganization plan, which the company has yet to submit and which requires creditor approval. Tracy Hope Davis, a United States trustee and a Justice Department monitor for the bankruptcy, also opposed Mr. Horton's severance. ''It's American Airlines' current intention to address Mr. Horton's compensation arrangement in the plan of reorganization,'' said Mike Trevino, a company spokesman. The combined company, keeping the American Airlines name, would be run by Doug Parker, the chief executive of US Airways, with Mr. Horton serving as nonexecutive chairman. Mr. Parker would become chairman after the first shareholder meeting of the combined company, probably in the spring of 2014. Mr. Horton first joined AMR in 1985, left in 2002 for a four-year stint at AT&T and then returned. He became chief of AMR when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. AMR at first opposed the merger, but reversed itself under pressure from creditors. The merger would create the world's largest airline, and AMR and US Airways hope to save more than $1 billion in annual costs by 2015.The broadband Internet business continues to look bright for Comcast, which reported profit and revenue increases on Wednesday that surpassed analysts' already sunny projections. In the second quarter -- Comcast's first full quarter owning 100 percent of NBCUniversal, in which it had previously held a 51 percent stake -- earnings rose to $1.7 billion, or 65 cents a share, from $1.35 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had been expecting earnings of 63 cents a share. Total revenue rose 7 percent, to $16.3 billion, from the second quarter of 2012, lifted by the continued growth of the company's broadband Internet and business products. Free cash flow increased 25 percent, to $1.9 billion. Comcast was the first major television and Internet provider to report quarterly earnings, so its healthy results may augur more good news when others report in the weeks to come. It is broadband, not cable television, that is generally bolstering cable companies' results these days, because nearly nine out of 10 American households already subscribe to some sort of TV, but only two-thirds subscribe to broadband. Comcast gained 187,000 new broadband subscribers in the second quarter. Comcast has been losing TV subscribers to DirecTV and Verizon FiOS for years. It lost another 159,000 in the second quarter, but the rate of loss has slowed lately. The company squeezed a 2.7 percent revenue gain from its television business, largely through rates increases and subscribers who chose more expensive packages. Its revenue gain on the broadband side, however, was 8 percent. ''Cable had outstanding growth, particularly in high-speed Internet, and NBCUniversal had strong performance across all of its businesses,'' Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, said in a statement. He credited the company's ''focus on delivering innovative products and a superior customer experience is driving our success, including stronger video, voice and business services results in cable.'' At midday, Comcast stock was up more than 5 percent, passing the $45 and nearing a record high. Mike McCormack, a media analyst for Nomura, said in a note to investors that NBCUniversal's performance also exceeded expectations, ''with filmed entertainment and broadcast television revenue offsetting weaker-than-expected theme parks revenue.'' NBC's cable channels, including USA, Syfy and Bravo, posted a 7.7 percent increase in revenue, to $2.41 billion in the quarter, while its somewhat smaller broadcast business, which has been in a rebuilding mode, had a 11.6 percent bump, to $1.73 billion. Mr. McCormack attributed the broadcast unit's gains to ''better ratings and higher retransmission consent fees.'' With regards to the ratings, Comcast executives credited ''The Voice,'' the singing competition on NBC that has given the network some much-needed momentum. Over all at NBCUniversal, revenue was up 8.9 percent year-over-year, to almost $6 billion.A gloomy earnings report and outlook on Wednesday from Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment company, helped to pull two of the three major American indexes lower. The drop for the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gave the stock market two consecutive days of losses, for the first time in a month. Caterpillar's earnings fell 43 percent in the second quarter as China's economy slowed and commodity prices sank. The company also warned of slowing revenue and profit, and its stock dropped $2.08, or 2 percent, to $83.44. Nine of 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 ended lower. The holdouts were technology companies, which got a lift from Apple's surging stock. Apple shares jumped $21.52, or 5 percent, to $440.51. The Nasdaq composite index, which lists many technology companies, edged up 0.33 of a point, or less than 0.1 percent, to 3,579.60. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.50 points, or 0.2 percent, at 15,542.24. The S. & P. 500-stock index fell 6.45 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,685.94. Although far from a blockbuster earnings season, the larger trend for corporate profits appears strong. Analysts forecast that second-quarter earnings for companies in the S.& P. 500 increased 4.2 percent over the same period last year, according to S&P Capital IQ. At the start of the month, those analysts were looking for earnings to rise 2.8 percent. More than six out of every 10 companies have surpassed Wall Street's profit targets. ''Yes, they're beating expectations, but expectations are so low,'' said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial. But financial firms, like Goldman Sachs and Capital One, have posted the highest rate of earnings growth of any industry. Ignore their results, however, and earnings are on track to slump 3.5 percent, according to FactSet. ''You can't call this a blowout quarter so far,'' Mr. McMillan said. In the market for government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 21/32 to 92 26/32, to yield 2.58 percent, up from 2.51 percent late Tuesday.WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Bank of America has agreed to pay $165 million to settle accusations from the federal agency that regulates credit unions over sales of mortgage-backed securities to corporate credit unions that led them to fail, the agency said on Tuesday. Bank of America disclosed in February that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and said the cost of the settlement would be covered by existing reserves, but it did not then disclose the amount it would pay. The settlement adds to a growing list of mortgage-related legal troubles that Bank of America has been able to put behind it after sustaining more than $40 billion in losses from its home loan business since the financial crisis. Most of those losses stemmed from its 2008 purchase of Countrywide Financial, once the largest American subprime mortgage lender. The new settlement is intended to resolve claims over mortgage securities offerings that the regulator had threatened to sue the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units over, Bank of America said in its annual report. A bank spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday beyond the earlier filing. The credit union regulator did not release settlement papers and declined to provide additional details about the deal. In recent months, Bank of America has moved closer to ending its mortgage troubles, with more than $14 billion in settlements announced in January alone. Around $3 billion went to end a loan-by-loan review of past foreclosures required by the government. An additional $11.6 billion went to resolve accusations from the mortgage finance company Fannie Mae that the bank had improperly sold mortgages that later soured, and to resolve questions about foreclosure delays. The bank has also sought to sign a $8.5 billion settlement to resolve claims from private investors who bought shaky securities. That deal is still awaiting approval in state court in New York. The credit union regulator previously indicated that it objected to that proposed deal, but last week it withdrew its notice of intent to object without providing a reason for the change. Bank of America did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, the credit union regulator said.Not since builders stuck a dirigible mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, eclipsing the Chrysler Building as the world's tallest tower, have developers been engaged in the type of skyscraper war that New York City is now witnessing. But unlike the rivalries of the early 20th century, when buildings pierced the clouds to house corporate headquarters, this one involves no fewer than three alpine condominiums with penthouses on the 90th floor and higher, which are being built to woo big-spending American hedge funders, Chinese magnates and Russian oligarchs. Two of them will rise above the 1,250-foot-high Empire State Building, by 300 feet and 146 feet, respectively (although the Empire State Building officially tops off at 1,454 feet when its lighting rod is included). Constructing the world's tallest towers is not for the faint of heart, and for modern-day building barons it might be the ultimate statement of ego. Call it an edifice complex, and think Donald J. Trump, whose name is plastered across his properties (and who in fact held the record for tallest residential building for a decade until recently). New York is a business town, however, and for developers, economics play as big a role as their desire to leave a mark on the skyline. ''It is really an economic proposition, a business plan that has to have logic behind it,'' said Carol Willis, the founder and director of the Skyscraper Museum. ''This is not some irrational fad.'' So while the marketing for these towers might have you believe that it's all about which living room can reach farthest into the sky, the reality is more nuanced. For a skyscraper project to succeed, many pieces of the development puzzle have to fall perfectly into place. There is the often arduous and lengthy process of buying up air rights -- or unused development rights -- from adjacent properties; borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars in financing; and engineering architecturally unique structures that can rise 90 stories or more. The construction, meanwhile, includes costly techniques to prevent the towers from swaying in the wind, and thicker support walls and columns that can scuttle some layout plans. Then there is the pure physicality of hoisting materials and laborers 1,000 feet into the air, sometimes creating safety hazards and delays. Considering these complexities, and the fact that the real estate market is just now recovering from one of its biggest crashes in decades, the pace of this skyscraper competition is breathtaking. Trump World Tower, opening in 2001 at 861 feet high -- its black edifice looming above the East River on First Avenue -- held the title of city's tallest residential building until 2011, with the opening of 8 Spruce Street, the 870-foot undulating rental building at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. Since then, developers have begun six separate projects that will shatter 8 Spruce's record. And even those that don't quite break that record are marketing their height as a selling point. At 56 Leonard Street, for example, the Herzog & De Meuron-designed condominium is just 821 feet in height, but it has made much of the fact it will be the tallest residential building in TriBeCa, charging as much as $50 million for a penthouse. The competition is even spreading beyond Manhattan, with the tallest tower in Queens, a 50-story condominium in Long Island City, now under way. It is not surprising that in a city known for its outsized personalities, many of these projects involve New York's most conspicuous developers. Harry B. Macklowe, for example, is developing 432 Park Avenue, the 96-story condominium in Midtown that, at 1,396 feet, will be the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed in 2015. Best known for his buccaneering style, Mr. Macklowe is a poster child for the last real estate boom and bust, mostly because at the cycle's pinnacle in 2007, he spent an astounding $7 billion to acquire seven Midtown towers, only to lose them in the crash. Mr. Macklowe began envisioning 432 Park in 2006, when he bought the former Drake Hotel. But he loaded the property with debt and was soon facing foreclosure. CIM Group, a private equity firm, eventually stepped in to save him, although he remains a co-developer. More than one-third of the units are now in contract for nearly $1 billion in potential sales, including a $95 million penthouse that could set a price record if it closes. Seemingly a success, 432 Park has faced its challenges, said Mr. Macklowe recently during an interview at the condominium's sales office; he was dressed in a tailored navy suit. ''It looks easy,'' he said, ''but that is like seeing Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio hit a home run and saying it looks easy.'' The sales office, on the 21st floor of the GM Building on Fifth Avenue, sits 100 feet shy of the lowest floors of 432 Park's condominium residences, giving potential buyers just a hint of the views to come. But the housing of the sales office there was in some ways a curious choice. In 2003, Mr. Macklowe broke a record in buying the GM Building for $1.4 billion, then used it as collateral on that spectacular $7 billion real estate bet that soured; he rents his offices there. Where Mr. Macklowe is brash -- he performed in the Off Broadway show ''Old Jews Telling Jokes'' and sometimes reverts to a period accent while telling stories -- Gary Barnett, the developer of the tower that may eventually eclipse 432 Park for the Western Hemisphere record, is understated. Mr. Barnett is by some measures the city's most active developer. Indeed One57, the 90-story, 1,004-foot-tall tower he is building at 157 West 57th Street, was to have taken the hemisphere record until it was supplanted by 432 Park. But he may yet reclaim the title with his planned 227 West 57th. Just west of One57, the tower has enough air rights to rise 1,550 feet; a feature will be the city's first Nordstrom department store. Born Gershon Swiatycki on the Lower East Side, Mr. Barnett, an Orthodox Jew who has 10 children, has always been a mercurial character in New York real estate circles. Formerly a diamond trader in Belgium, he rose to prominence in 2005, when he unsuccessfully challenged Bruce Ratner with a rival bid for Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. A key to his success has been his quiet ability to amass large parcels from individual property owners in prime Manhattan locations. The process can take years, and requires slow and deliberate strategizing. For One57, for example, Mr. Barnett began buying the air rights some 16 years ago. ''Building tall is not about bragging rights,'' he said recently, during a conversation in the nondescript conference room of his offices on Third Avenue; he was wearing slacks and a mock turtleneck. ''What drives the building is design, the views, the economics.'' He built One57 to its full height ''because we couldn't get in all the air rights any other way -- once you have it, the ability to build it, I didn't want to just throw it away.'' Still, deciding a building's height is a judgment call, and ''there have been times that I had air rights but I didn't end up using them,'' he said. Extreme height adds time and uncertainty to a project, as well as construction costs. One57, for instance, was waylaid when Hurricane Sandy snapped off a crane boom and left it dangling far above the street. Mr. Barnett is weighing these considerations for his Nordstrom property, he said, and said he may choose to forego the full 1,550 feet. Perhaps the biggest factor in determining height is the views. As Ms. Willis put it, ''Views are the reason to capitalize on the sky -- they are the thing that allows you to ask very high prices.'' And the most desirable views in New York are of Central Park, which is one reason many of these towers are clustered in and around 57th Street. Zoning in Midtown also helps, since it can allow for extremely tall buildings. In the case of 432 Park, for example, the floor plate was 8,500 square feet and Mr. Macklowe had some 500,000 square feet to utilize. ''So the height was just a matter of arithmetic,'' he said. ''We didn't start out by saying we wanted to build the tallest residential building in Manhattan,'' he added, ''but as we got there, and saw it was within the zoning, we went for it. It was only later that we recognized the significance of using this as a tag line.'' ''It isn't as if tall towers are some great statement of testosterone, or some masculine symbol,'' summarized MaryAnne Gilmartin, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, which developed 8 Spruce. ''It has been proven time and again that height and views are one of the great attributes of city living. If you can live in the sky, then why not?''Not since builders stuck a dirigible mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, eclipsing the Chrysler Building as the world's tallest tower, have developers been engaged in the type of skyscraper war that New York City is now witnessing.

Macklowe, for example, is developing 432 Park Avenue, the 96-story condominium in Midtown that, at 1,396 feet, will be the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed in 2015. Best known for his buccaneering style, Mr. Macklowe is a poster child for the last real estate boom and bust, mostly because at the cycle's pinnacle in 2007, he spent an astounding $7 billion to acquire seven Midtown towers, only to lose them in the crash. Mr. Macklowe began envisioning 432 Park in 2006, when he bought the former Drake Hotel. But he loaded the property with debt and was soon facing foreclosure. CIM Group, a private equity firm, eventually stepped in to save him, although he remains a co-developer. More than one-third of the units are now in contract for nearly $1 billion in potential sales, including a $95 million penthouse that could set a price record if it closes. Seemingly a success, 432 Park has faced its challenges, said Mr. Macklowe recently during an interview at the condominium's sales office; he was dressed in a tailored navy suit. ''It looks easy,'' he said, ''but that is like seeing Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio hit a home run and saying it looks easy.'' The sales office, on the 21st floor of the GM Building on Fifth Avenue, sits 100 feet shy of the lowest floors of 432 Park's condominium residences, giving potential buyers just a hint of the views to come. But the housing of the sales office there was in some ways a curious choice. In 2003, Mr. Macklowe broke a record in buying the GM Building for $1.4 billion, then used it as collateral on that spectacular $7 billion real estate bet that soured; he rents his offices there. Where Mr. Macklowe is brash -- he performed in the Off Broadway show ''Old Jews Telling Jokes'' and sometimes reverts to a period accent while telling stories -- Gary Barnett, the developer of the tower that may eventually eclipse 432 Park for the Western Hemisphere record, is understated. Mr. Barnett is by some measures the city's most active developer. Indeed One57, the 90-story, 1,004-foot-tall tower he is building at 157 West 57th Street, was to have taken the hemisphere record until it was supplanted by 432 Park. But he may yet reclaim the title with his planned 227 West 57th. Just west of One57, the tower has enough air rights to rise 1,550 feet; a feature will be the city's first Nordstrom department store. Born Gershon Swiatycki on the Lower East Side, Mr. Barnett, an Orthodox Jew who has 10 children, has always been a mercurial character in New York real estate circles. Formerly a diamond trader in Belgium, he rose to prominence in 2005, when he unsuccessfully challenged Bruce Ratner with a rival bid for Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. A key to his success has been his quiet ability to amass large parcels from individual property owners in prime Manhattan locations. The process can take years, and requires slow and deliberate strategizing. For One57, for example, Mr. Barnett began buying the air rights some 16 years ago. ''Building tall is not about bragging rights,'' he said recently, during a conversation in the nondescript conference room of his offices on Third Avenue; he was wearing slacks and a mock turtleneck. ''What drives the building is design, the views, the economics.'' He built One57 to its full height ''because we couldn't get in all the air rights any other way -- once you have it, the ability to build it, I didn't want to just throw it away.'' Still, deciding a building's height is a judgment call, and ''there have been times that I had air rights but I didn't end up using them,'' he said. Extreme height adds time and uncertainty to a project, as well as construction costs. One57, for instance, was waylaid when Hurricane Sandy snapped off a crane boom and left it dangling far above the street. Mr. Barnett is weighing these considerations for his Nordstrom property, he said, and said he may choose to forego the full 1,550 feet. Perhaps the biggest factor in determining height is the views. As Ms. Willis put it, ''Views are the reason to capitalize on the sky -- they are the thing that allows you to ask very high prices.'' And the most desirable views in New York are of Central Park, which is one reason many of these towers are clustered in and around 57th Street. Zoning in Midtown also helps, since it can allow for extremely tall buildings. In the case of 432 Park, for example, the floor plate was 8,500 square feet and Mr. Macklowe had some 500,000 square feet to utilize. ''So the height was just a matter of arithmetic,'' he said. ''We didn't start out by saying we wanted to build the tallest residential building in Manhattan,'' he added, ''but as we got there, and saw it was within the zoning, we went for it. It was only later that we recognized the significance of using this as a tag line.'' ''It isn't as if tall towers are some great statement of testosterone, or some masculine symbol,'' summarized MaryAnne Gilmartin, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, which developed 8 Spruce. ''It has been proven time and again that height and views are one of the great attributes of city living. If you can live in the sky, then why not?''AT&T reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday that missed Wall Street expectations because it was hit by rising costs. AT&T's revenue benefited from growth in the company's wireless and enterprise businesses, but strong wireless growth comes at a price because the company has to heavily subsidize new smartphone purchases by customers signing long-term contracts. ''Both wireline and wireless revenue were a little better than I expected,'' said Todd Rethemeier, an analyst with Hudson Square Research, but he noted that the difference was not big enough to increase the company's share price. AT&T's revenue rose 1.6 percent in the second quarter, to $32.08 billion, from $31.58 billion a year earlier, compared with Wall Street expectations for $31.81 billion. The company's earnings of 67 cents a share, excluding one-time items, were a penny behind analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. Net income slipped 2.1 percent in the latest quarter, to $3.82 billion, or 71 cents a share, compared with $3.9 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter when there were more shares outstanding. AT&T, the nation's No. 2 mobile service provider after Verizon Wireless, said it added more than 550,000 contract customers in the second quarter, slightly ahead of its target for about 500,000 and an improvement from its 320,000 net additions in the year-earlier quarter. This growth, however, pushed down AT&T's wireless profit margin to 42.4 percent in the second quarter compared with 45.8 percent a year earlier because of the smartphone subsidies. And the company's subscriber growth was still well behind the 941,000 net additions at Verizon. AT&T also faced additional pressure in the second quarter as its smaller rival, T-Mobile US, started selling the Apple iPhone, a top seller for AT&T. John J. Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, told analysts that the company was on track to meet its goal of 2 percent growth in revenue for the full year.The Penguin Group USA has agreed to pay $75 million to settle accusations of e-book price fixing, the publisher said on Wednesday. ''Penguin has reached a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. State Attorneys General and private class plaintiffs to pay $75 million in consumer damages plus costs and fees to resolve all antitrust claims relating to e-book pricing,'' the publisher said in a statement. Before reaching the agreement, Penguin made a ''$40 million provision for settlement in its 2012 accounts,'' the company added. Penguin settled a similar claim with the Department of Justice in December. The settlement announced on Wednesday is subject to court approval. Apple is expected to go to court to defend itself against an antitrust lawsuit from the Justice Department that accuses it of colluding with five major publishers to set e-book prices. The trial is scheduled to begin on June 3 in Federal District Court in New York.PARIS -- European car sales tumbled again in May, reaching their lowest level in 20 years, manufacturers' data showed Tuesday, but analysts and industry officials said the market might have finally begun to bottom out. Sales fell 5.9 percent in May from a year earlier, to 1.04 million units, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported from Brussels. The association said it was the smallest number of vehicles sold in the month since May 1993, when the number stood below one million. The European auto market peaked in 2007 at nearly 16 million new passenger vehicles, but it has been in retreat ever since. In the five months through May, new-car sales were declining at a 6.8 percent annual pace, somewhat worse than most forecasts at the start of the year. Five years after the financial crisis arrived, Europe is still struggling to restart economic growth, and households remain extremely reluctant about big purchases like automobiles. The unemployment rate of the 17-nation euro zone stood at a record high of 12.2 percent in April, and nearly 27 million men and women across the wider European Union were unable to find jobs. Among young people, a top demographic for the future of the auto industry, the jobless problem is even worse. Carlos Da Silva, an analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that despite the dreary news, the rate of decline in the market appeared to have begun slowing since the start of the second quarter. While that was not the same thing as an end to the decline, he noted, it suggested that the second half would not be as bad as the beginning of the year. Mr. Da Silva forecast that sales of new cars in Europe would shrink about 4 percent this year from 2012, when 12.05 million vehicles were sold, the lowest level since 1995. Globally, car sales will rise about 3 percent this year, Mr. Da Silva said. The North American market will gain about 6 percent, and China as much as 10 percent to 11 percent. The only major market expected to fare worse than Europe, he said, was Japan, which would shrink 7 percent. By early 2014, he said, European car sales should begin rising in the single digits. ''But 'recovery' is a big word,'' he said, as most of the demand now is to replace older, worn-out vehicles, and it is likely that growth in Western Europe will be ''muted'' for years to come. Wolfgang Eder, chief executive of the Austrian steel maker Voestalpine, said Tuesday that his own observations confirmed that the European market had hit bottom in recent months, but that he did not expect a strong recovery soon. ''We don't expect sales will go down anymore,'' Mr. Eder told a small group of journalists in Frankfurt. ''But, based on what we hear from customers, we don't expect a big increase, either.'' Based in Linz, Austria, Voestalpine is a major supplier of auto-body parts and other components to automakers. The industry figures Tuesday cover new passenger car registrations in the 27-nation European Union, with the exception of Malta, for which the latest figures were not available. The data showed a pattern across the major markets that has been largely consistent this year; only Britain expanded in May from a year earlier, while Spain, Italy, Germany and France all lost ground. European sales at the Volkswagen Group, the largest European automaker, which includes the Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda brands, fell 2.6 percent over all in May from a year earlier. Sales at PSA Peugeot Citroën, the second-largest carmaker, fell 13.4 percent. Renault's sales fell 9.5 percent, while Fiat's sales fell 10.8 percent. General Motors' European sales slid 11.6 percent, led by a 22.4 percent decline in the Chevrolet brand. Ford Motor's sales were little changed, down 0.6 percent.PARIS -- European new car sales contracted in March for an 18th consecutive month, led by declines in Germany and France, industry data showed on Wednesday. New vehicle registrations in the European Union fell 10.2 percent from a year ago, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported from Brussels, slipping to 1.3 million vehicles from about 1.5 million. Over the first three months of the year, sales in the 27-nation bloc totaled slightly fewer than three million units, 9.8 percent below the level of a year ago, making the worst start to a year since the association began collecting the data in 1990, when only 15 nations' sales were considered. Quynh-Nhu Huynh, statistical director for the association, said that it had predicted a 5 percent decline in 2013 sales from the 12 million units sold in 2012, but that the forecast might have to be revisited soon because of the poor start. Economic stagnation continues to depress demand in the European Union long after auto sales in the United States have rebounded and while emerging markets have continued to register growth. Across Europe, more than 26 million men and women are unemployed, according to official data, and the overall economy is expected to contract in 2013 for a second straight year. The car industry directly accounts for more than two million jobs in Europe, including some of the best-paid manufacturing jobs, and another 10 million ''indirect'' jobs, according to the association. But many of the Continent's ailing carmakers are trying to reorganize, cut their work forces and, in some cases, close plants, medicine that may make the economy sicker in the short term. Peter Fuss, who follows the market at the Ernst & Young Global Automotive Center, predicted that 2013 European car sales would decline by as much as 7 percent from 2012. But carmakers will have to continue discounting prices even to hold the decline to that level, Mr. Fuss said, putting further pressure on profits. The course of the German and British economies will help to determine the industry's fortunes, he said. ''We expect the French, Italian and Spanish markets to continue their decline over the rest of the year in the absence of any major government intervention to encourage vehicle buying or replacement,'' he said. The data released on Wednesday showed that sales in Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, fell 17.1 percent. Economic sentiment among Germans declined sharply in the last month, according to a report on Tuesday from the ZEW research institute. In France, hobbled by a weak economy and 10.8 percent unemployment, sales fell 16.2 percent. The only expansion among major markets was a 4.9 percent increase in Britain, which is outside the euro zone. Sales for Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, slid 9 percent, with the biggest decline at its namesake brand. Sales at PSA Peugeot Citroën, No. 2 in Europe, plunged 16 percent. Ford Motor's sales slid 15.8 percent, while General Motors' tumbled 12.6 percent. The data confirmed that the high-end market, which had held up even as the mass market withered, has also begun to lose steam. Sales at Daimler, which warned last week that its 2013 profit forecast was beginning to look shaky, fell 1.2 percent, while its rival, BMW, posted a 4.7 percent drop in sales.abatheja@texastribune.org kgalbraith@texastribune.org  Touting Texas' low taxes and light regulations, Gov. Rick Perry has relished trying to poach jobs from other states. In February, he described building a business in California as ''next to impossible.'' Last month, he warned Illinois entrepreneurs to ''get out while there's still time.'' Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago had a ready retort. ''We don't have to measure our showers like they do in Texas,'' he said. Mr. Emanuel's jab was well aimed. Texas' drought and water-supply problems have captured headlines and inspired frank, worried comments from Texas officials. But with the state's rapid population growth projected to continue in future decades, other infrastructure problems also loom, including clogged roads and a strained power grid. ''If we don't address these issues, the message is -- don't go to Texas,'' Bill Hammond, the president of the Texas Association of Business, said of financing for water and roads. (The Texas Association of Business is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) The challenge is prominently on display in the waning days of the state legislative session. Lawmakers have access to a multibillion-dollar budget surplus but are struggling to find ways to finance roads and water projects that can draw support from Republican majorities wary of the proposals' large price tags. ''Everybody right now is saying no new fees and no new taxes,'' said Ed Emmett, the Harris County judge, who is looking for state financing for roads that would support busy and expanding gulf coast ports. ''And you have to spend money to build roads.'' Texas' population growth has propelled infrastructure strains into the spotlight. The statistics breed superlatives. From 2011 to 2012, Midland, an oil boomtown, ranked as the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan area, according to the United States Census Bureau. Of metropolitan areas with at least one million people, Austin was the fastest growing; Houston, Dallas and San Antonio also made the top 10. ''The state's population has more than doubled since 1970,'' said Michael Cline, the associate director of the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University. ''It will probably more than double in the next 40 years.'' (Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.) Mr. Perry has a record of backing large infrastructure projects. Last decade, he supported a multibillion-dollar project to string transmission lines across Texas to harvest power from wind farms, and he also pushed, unsuccessfully, for a huge network of toll road, rail and utility corridors. Recently he has highlighted infrastructure challenges anew, warning that ignoring them will end the ''Texas miracle,'' shorthand for the state's recent economic success. ''It's also important to remember that a big part of convincing employers to come to Texas is convincing them we'll have adequate electricity, water and transportation infrastructure to fit their needs,'' Mr. Perry said last month in a speech to the Texas Lyceum conference on infrastructure. ''Now is the time to make sure we do.'' Of Texas' infrastructure challenges, water is considered the most pressing. Nearly three years of drought have taken a toll on reservoirs and aquifers. Two key reservoirs that supply Austin have fallen so low -- they are currently 39 percent full -- that most rice farmers downriver have been barred from using water from them this year and were last year as well. Eight small communities could run out of water within 45 days, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and more than 20 others could be out by the end of the year. ''Water is going to be the great scarce natural resource in Texas in the 21st century,'' said Stephen L. Klineberg, co-director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice. Mr. Perry and other top officials have made water financing a priority during the legislative session, which ends in 10 days. After a protracted debate during this session on where the money should come from, budget leaders appeared poised to come to a deal on taking $2 billion from the state's bulging Rainy Day Fund, fed largely by oil and gas tax revenues, to endow a special fund for water projects. Voters may need to approve the fund. Road financing, another of Mr. Perry's stated priorities this session, faces a trickier future. The Texas Department of Transportation has relied heavily on borrowed money and tolls in recent years to develop new roads. Its officials have warned lawmakers that they need $4 billion extra annually just to maintain the current level of congestion. Efforts to find at least some of that financing have met significant resistance this session, particularly from Tea Party-friendly Republicans uninterested in raising vehicle registration fees or allowing the state to take on more debt. Talk of increasing financing for public transportation, which planning experts consider crucial for absorbing urban growth, has also met stiff resistance. The department has enough financing on hand to continue projects through 2015, creating a perception that its situation could be handled in the legislative session scheduled for that year. Senator Robert Nichols, Republican of Jacksonville and chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said that sentiment ignored how transportation projects develop. ''TxDOT needs to plan six years out, eight years out,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''You cannot do that if you don't know what revenue is going to be.'' The size of the challenge was evident at last month's Texas Lyceum conference, as speaker after speaker tried to convey how the state's runaway population growth and road network were on a collision course. ''We are looking at somewhere around 150 people moving to Austin every single day,'' said Linda Watson, president of Capital Metro, that city's public transportation provider. ''That's putting 70 cars on the road every day.'' A third infrastructure issue, the state's laboring power grid, has been a less visible concern for lawmakers. Texas has its own power grid, and keeping up with the summer air-conditioning load of a growing number of customers poses a perpetual challenge. Relatively low power prices have diminished the incentives for power companies to build new plants. It is a problem that regulators are trying to solve, in part, by raising the maximum price that electricity-generating companies can get for their power. But in recent reports compiled at the behest of Congress, the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation has singled out the Texas grid as having particularly serious challenges in meeting future demand. In economically prosperous parts of the state, infrastructure concerns are only growing more pressing. An oil drilling boom in West and South Texas has brought heavy truck traffic, leading to torn-up roads and a sharp rise in vehicle collisions, while also increasing strains on water and power supplies. Gulf coast ports are eager to accommodate rising trade, according to Mr. Emmett of Harris County, but need government money to assist with road and rail. Without improvements to the infrastructure supporting the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, ''our economy will stagnate,'' said Mr. Emmett, who also heads the Transportation Department's freight advisory committee. ''You have to invest in infrastructure now in order to have an infrastructure in place for 20 and 30 years from now.''LONDON -- BP reported a first-quarter profit of $4.2 billion on Tuesday after adjusting for inventory changes and one-time items, handily beating analysts' forecasts. BP earned 30 percent more than analysts had forecast, as new operations came onstream in Angola and Norway, oil and gas trading earned more than $500 million above average, and BP's costs per barrel produced fell slightly compared with the same period in 2012. Even though the profit after the one-off items was 9 percent lower than the same quarter last year, Peter Hutton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, called the report ''a very positive set of results.'' The chief executive, Robert W. Dudley, said in a statement that ''these strong first-quarter results demonstrate the progress BP is making.'' The main disappointment in the quarter was an 18 percent year-on-year fall in production in the United States, in part reflecting the company's continued struggles to bring back its core deepwater production in the Gulf of Mexico after the blowout disaster there in 2010. BP is a much smaller company than it was before the disaster, which killed 11 people and spilled millions of barrels of oil. Since the start of 2010, BP has sold about $65 billion in assets to pay spill costs and reshape the company. Production in the first quarter, 2.3 million barrels a day, was down about 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2012 and roughly half the output of Exxon Mobil. In 2009, BP's production was four million barrels a day, comparable to Exxon Mobil's. The big difference comes from the sale of BP's 50 percent stake in its Russian affiliate, TNK-BP, to Rosneft for $12.5 billion in cash and $14 billion in shares of Rosneft, which is majority-owned by the Russian government. BP's stake in Rosneft, which rose to 19.75 percent in the transaction, will bring its overall output back over three million barrels a day, the company says. Including the TNK-BP sale, BP's overall net income for the period was $16.6 billion, compared with $4.8 billion a year earlier. According to the company, the gain on the sale was $15.5 billion, but under accounting rules it is reporting $12.5 billion of the profit while deferring $3 billion until later years. BP has begun a share-buyback program worth $8 billion, acquiring shares worth $834 million, the company said. Mr. Dudley, trying to create a more focused and profitable company, has also trimmed BP's holdings extensively, even in the Gulf of Mexico. BP still faces huge uncertainties over how high the damages from the spill could go. On April 17, a federal judge in New Orleans ended the first phase of a trial to determine, among other matters, whether BP or other parties had been grossly negligent in the series of events that led up to the spill. The second phase, focusing on the amount of oil spilled, is to begin in September. What the judge eventually rules could make a difference of tens of billions of dollars in penalties. In the meantime, the flow of lawsuits continues. BP says it has been among the companies named as defendants in more than 2,200 suits filed in federal and state courts since March 6.MBIA, the bond insurer, on Monday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by the Bank of America Corporation and Société Générale that challenged its 2009 restructuring, and its shares climbed 24 percent. Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of New York State Supreme Court said Eric R. Dinallo, the state insurance superintendent at the time, was not ''arbitrary and capricious'' in authorizing a split of MBIA's municipal bond business from a structured finance unit that had suffered big losses from guaranteeing debt backed by risky mortgages. Bank of America and Société Générale, the French bank, were the remaining plaintiffs among 18 financial companies that said the split of MBIA defrauded them as policyholders. They said it left the MBIA Insurance unit undercapitalized, and siphoned $5 billion from the unit to benefit another entity, the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, at their expense. But in her decision, Justice Kapnick said it was not her job to second-guess Mr. Dinallo's decision, which had a rational basis. MBIA had supported the restructuring as a means to help unfreeze municipal finance markets after the 2008 financial crisis. ''Dinallo found that the transaction was 'fair and equitable,' '' Justice Kapnick wrote, because it would leave MBIA Insurance ''solvent and that those policyholders' claims would be paid as they came due.'' She said Mr. Dinallo interpreted the law in a manner that was not ''irrational or unreasonable.'' Justice Kapnick said her decision did not affect claims by the banks against MBIA itself in a case that the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, allowed to go ahead in June 2011. The judge oversaw a three-week nonjury proceeding over the restructuring last May and June in her Manhattan court. Robert J. Giuffra Jr., a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell representing Bank of America and Société Générale, said the banks planned to appeal the decision. MBIA's chief executive, Joseph W. Brown, said in a statement that he was pleased with the decision, and that the company, based in Armonk, N.Y., looked forward to resolving the remaining litigation. After Justice Kapnick's ruling, MBIA's shares surged $2.47 to close at $12.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. In their lawsuit, Bank of America and Société Générale sought to force MBIA to set aside $2.09 billion in dividends, cash and securities it had received from its insurance unit for the benefit of creditors. Alternatively, the banks sought to force the state, or MBIA Insurance directors, to sue the parent company to recover that sum. A Bank of America spokesman, Lawrence Grayson, and a Société Générale spokesman, Jim Galvin, said in separate statements: ''We continue to believe that MBIA wrongfully transferred $5 billion from its structured finance subsidiary, to the harm of its policyholders, which we intend to prove in the separate fraudulent conveyance litigation that is under way.''LONDON -- Evidence of a rebound in manufacturing activity in China and Europe helped stock markets rise in much of the world on Monday, although Wall Street's closure for Labor Day kept trading volumes light. In Britain, the FTSE 100 added 1.5 percent, to close at 6,506.19. Much of that gain came from Vodafone, which is selling its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications. Confirmation of that $130 billion deal came after trading in London had closed, but Vodafone's shares closed up 3.4 percent on expectations of the purchase. Germany's DAX index ended the day up 1.7 percent, to 8,243.87 while France's CAC-40 was up 1.8 percent, to 4,006.01. Italian and Spanish stocks also advanced after surveys showed that manufacturing activity rose in the two countries, which are in recession and have been focal points of Europe's debt crisis. Global market sentiment was also bolstered by two surveys that showed China's manufacturing sector improved last month after prolonged weakness. The HSBC purchasing managers' index rose to 50.1 points in August, a level that indicates expansion as output and new orders edged up slightly and order backlogs rose at the fastest pace in two years. The official China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing P.M.I. rose to 51.0 from July's 50.3, which was the highest level and biggest increase this year. On Monday, the leading stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia all rose more than 1 percent. Crude oil for October delivery declined $1.08, to $106.57 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as fears of an imminent American military strike on Syria continued to fade.Accounts â-  E*Trade Financial, New York, and Grey New York -- part of the Grey unit of the Grey Group, owned by WPP -- are parting ways after working together since November 2007; during that time, Grey New York created the popular character known as the E*Trade baby, which appears in commercials and online ads. E*Trade Financial spent more than $110 million on advertising last year.

It hardly qualifies as a defense. But that is perhaps the most accurate statement that Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, could have made to lawmakers inquiring last week about how its creative financial techniques contributed to its low business tax payments. You may have heard of Google's ''Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich'' -- an increasingly popular route through Ireland and the Netherlands that cleanses corporate cash of most of its tax liability. Amazon and Facebook like the sandwich, too. Don't forget the fabled tax wizards in General Electric's accounting department. Or what about Starbucks, which paid a grand total of $13 million in British corporate taxes over 15 years on revenue of more than $5 billion? Starbucks is not a complex technology firm with a subsidiary in a low-tax Caribbean island charging its headquarters through the nose to license some cutting-edge software patent. It's a chain of coffee shops, part of the predigital economy. Still, despite a 31 percent market share, the company's British subsidiary managed to report losses in 14 of its first 15 years. The case of Starbucks is particularly troubling for every government concerned about how it is going to finance itself in the future. As Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California noted: if Starbucks could generate so much ''stateless'' income -- beyond the reach of tax authorities both where it makes and sells the Frappuccinos and where it is incorporated as a company -- ''any multinational firm can.'' That means that as the government seeks new sources of revenue to pay for an expanding safety net and an aging population, it should probably look outside the corporate sector. ''We have a tax problem; we are not collecting enough tax revenue -- period,'' said Jim Hines of the University of Michigan. ''But we are never going to finance what we need with corporate taxes.'' Instead, governments seeking revenue might do best focusing their efforts on taxing people, who cannot flee as easily, or taxing what people consume. Some of this may come at the expense of progressivity in the tax code. The United States is the only advanced nation that does not have a value-added tax, which is similar to a sales tax and can raise lots of revenue. Peter Diamond from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has suggested increasing payroll taxes to pay for increased spending on Social Security. There are more progressive taxes -- say taxing the ''carried interest'' charged by fund managers at the same rate as regular income, or raising taxes on dividends. That could raise money, though probably less. But with countries around the globe in constant competition to lure investment by lowering tax rates and offering assorted breaks, taxing corporations will be an uphill battle. Multinational companies just have too many options to minimize their tax bill by routing profits through low-tax jurisdictions and losses through high-tax ones. In the industrial era of the early 1950s, corporate income tax contributed almost a third of the total tax revenue raised by the federal government, equivalent to about 6 percent of the nation's income. By the 1970s it generated about 3 percent. And in the last decade it raised around 2 percent of national income -- only about $1 in $10 of all federal tax dollars collected. Corporate tax revenues stopped shrinking as a share of the economy after the last major tax reform in the 1980s, moving up and down with the economic cycle. But they have failed to keep up with corporate profits' rising share of the economic pie. Part of this decline was by design. Notably, starting in the 1980s many companies were allowed to shed their corporate status so that their profits flowed directly to their owners -- generating no corporate tax. But globalization -- combined with financial legerdemain -- has opened wide new doors for companies to reduce their tax bill. For all the complaints about the high corporate rate, from 1987 through 2008 federal income taxes paid by American corporations amounted to only 25.6 percent of their domestic income, according to the Congressional Budget Office. On their foreign income they paid much less. A study based on 2006 tax records by Harry Grubert of the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis and Rosanne Altshuler of Rutgers University found that 37 percent of the profits of foreign subsidiaries of American corporations are taxed at a rate of less than 5 percent. More than half of the profits pay less than 15 percent in foreign taxes. And these profits are rarely taxed at home. The Internal Revenue Service collects corporate taxes only on foreign profits repatriated into the United States, a slim slice indeed. Last year, the largest American multinational corporations reportedly added $183 billion to their untaxed hoard of cash held overseas. In total, American companies have almost $2 trillion in profits ''permanently reinvested'' abroad. The corporate strategy is of dubious value. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the federal government loses about $10 billion to $60 billion a year from multinationals shifting profits to low-tax countries. Meanwhile, the ''foreign investment'' drawn by low-tax havens is often not the kind that generates jobs. When George W. Bush offered a tax holiday in 2004, allowing multinational companies to repatriate some $300 billion at a tax rate of 5.25 percent -- the money didn't come from places like China, Canada or Mexico, where American companies have big productive investments with lots of workers. The top sources were the Netherlands, Switzerland, Bermuda and Ireland. The practice is costly even for multinational firms themselves. Ms. Altshuler and Mr. Grubert noted that the companies that took advantage of the tax holiday paid an average of 3.6 percent on their repatriations, which means they thought the actual or implicit future costs of keeping the stash abroad would be at least this big. Could something be done to limit this? With many countries struggling with budget deficits, anger at multinationals hopping across tax jurisdictions is intensifying across the industrial world. The Obama administration proposed introducing a low global minimum tax rate of, say, 15 percent. Foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S. but would face no further taxes on repatriation. And an ''excess returns'' rule could subject high profits in low-tax countries to higher American taxes, a disincentive to tax avoidance. House Republicans, too, have proposed new rules to limit global tax-minimization strategies. But successfully combating corporate country-hopping is likely to require international cooperation. And low-tax countries are likely to resist tighter rules. ''Of course Ireland won't like it,'' said Pascal Saint-Amans, who heads the Center for Tax Policy at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been charged with drafting new standards to avoid multinational tax avoidance. Perhaps an interim solution is simply transparency: require corporations to disclose the taxes they pay in every jurisdiction they operate. Once it got out that Starbucks' British tax bill was next to nothing, the public outcry was so great that the company ''volunteered'' to pay about $15 million a year, just to avoid a potential boycott. Or maybe corporate taxes should just be kissed goodbye.The stock market rose Thursday after weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low, raising investor hopes that the labor market is improving. The report came a day before the government is to issue its report on April employment. ''Everyone is looking to the April jobs numbers,'' said Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer at Biltmore Capital. ''People are more confident that it was an anomaly last month and are looking for some bigger numbers.'' Economists forecast that employers added 160,000 jobs last month. Stocks slumped when the government said just 88,000 jobs were added in March, less than half the number forecast. Signs of increased hiring have supported this year's surge in stocks and pushed the market to record highs. The run-up has started to falter in recent weeks on concerns that the global economy is slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.63 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 14,831.58 on Thursday. The Dow lost 138 points a day earlier on signs that the government's employment report might turn out to be weak. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,597.59, also recovering almost all of its losses from a day earlier. Gains for technology companies helped push the Nasdaq composite index higher, as it advanced 41.49 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,340.62. Applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to 324,000, the fewest since January 2008, the Labor Department reported. The outlook for global growth was bolstered after the European Central Bank cuts its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5 percent. That contributed to the improved investor sentiment. Higher profits from CBS, Facebook and other companies also lifted stocks on Thursday. CBS reported a 22 percent jump in first-quarter earnings as big events like the Super Bowl pushed advertising revenue higher. Its stock rose 95 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.35. General Motors rose 98 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $31.16 after it lost less money in Europe and beat Wall Street's expectations for first-quarter profit. Facebook gained $1.54, or 5.6 percent, to $28.97 after its first-quarter revenue rose 38 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The social networking site bucked the trend for companies reporting in the first quarter. Most are exceeding analysts' expectations on earnings, but falling short on revenue. ''If we continue to see several more quarters like this, investors would start to get nervous,'' said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments. He said growth needed to pick up in the major export markets, like China and Europe, for American companies to maintain earnings growth. Technology stocks have surged in the past two weeks, after lagging the S.& P. 500 in the first three months of the year. Their 5.7 percent increase in 2013 still trails the 18.5 percent gain for health care companies, the best-performing industry in the index. In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 103 13/32, while its yield fell to 1.62 percent, its low for the year, from 1.63 percent on Wednesday.WASHINGTON -- President Obama's nominee for energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, is a consultant to the energy giant BP and a member of the advisory council and board of trustees of King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, among other positions, according to disclosure statements filed with the government and released on Friday. Dr. Moniz, who was under secretary of energy during the Clinton administration and is an advocate of natural gas and nuclear power as cleaner alternatives to coal, is also a director of ICF International, a prominent energy and policy consulting firm. He owns common and restricted stock worth $200,000 to $500,000 in that company, according to the statement, which lists assets and describes their value in broad ranges. In all, he holds assets worth $4.6 million to $17.9 million. He is also a consultant to General Electric and IHS CERA, the consulting firm formerly known as Cambridge Energy Research Associates, and a director at American Science and Engineering of Billerica, Mass., a company that does security work, including cargo screening. Dr. Moniz, a physicist, is a professor at M.I.T. and director of that institution's Energy Initiative, an industry-financed group that does research on energy technologies and climate change. Dr. Moniz told the ethics officer of the Energy Department, in a letter made public by the Office of Government Ethics on Friday, that he would resign from all of those positions upon his confirmation as energy secretary by the Senate. He also said he would follow government rules requiring him to not participate in decisions affecting those entities. He plans to sell his ICF shares within 90 days of his confirmation. Dr. Moniz has already been criticized for failing to disclose his ties to ICF and other firms in a study produced by his program at M.I.T., on the future of natural gas.SHORTLY before Ben S. Bernanke was nominated as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2005, he paid a return visit to Stanford, where he started his academic career in 1979. In a speech, he recalled that he and his wife, Anna, had rented a house with friends because he was certain that local real estate prices would fall. Instead, prices in the Bay Area doubled, then doubled again. ''Since then,'' Mr. Bernanke told his audience, ''I've developed a view that central bankers should not try to determine fundamental values of assets.'' Indeed, Mr. Bernanke's academic work, largely at Princeton, helped shape the conventional wisdom that central banks couldn't spot asset bubbles and shouldn't try to pop things that looked like bubbles. In his first speech as a Fed governor in 2002, he reiterated that trying to judge the sustainability of rapid increases in housing or stock prices was ''neither desirable nor feasible.'' Over the next several years, he said repeatedly that he saw no clear evidence of a housing bubble. And in 2004, the Bernankes paid a hefty $839,000 for a town house on Capitol Hill in Washington. It took a great recession to change his mind. The recession, prompted by the collapse of the housing bubble that Mr. Bernanke -- and most other experts -- failed to see coming, ended an era of minimalism in central banking. And there is no better marker than the views of Mr. Bernanke, the world's most influential central banker, who now argues that the Fed needs to consider a range of previously unthinkable actions, including trying to pop bubbles when necessary, because sometimes the cost of doing nothing is worse. Mr. Bernanke, who plans to step down in January after eight years as Fed chairman, will be remembered for helping to arrest the collapse of the financial system in 2008. This shy, methodical economist who had been expected to serve as the keeper of Alan Greenspan's flame -- to preserve the Fed's hard-won success in moderating inflation -- emerged under pressure as perhaps the most innovative and daring leader in the Fed's history. But what Mr. Bernanke did after the crisis may prove to have even more enduring influence. For almost three decades, the Fed focused on moderating inflation in the belief that this was the best and only way to help the economy. In the wake of the crisis, Mr. Bernanke forged a broader vision of the Fed's responsibilities, starting experimental, incomplete campaigns to reduce unemployment and to prevent future crises. The Bernanke Fed has failed to fully achieve its goals. Growth is still tepid, unemployment still too high, inflation still too low. Some critics continue to warn -- so far, incorrectly -- that its efforts will unleash inflation or destabilize financial markets. Yet many of the Fed's experiments are already being emulated by other central banks. And Mr. Bernanke's many admirers say it is hard to imagine that anyone else could have done more under the circumstances to restore the economy. Fortunately, they say, his lifelong study of central banking under stress meant that he not only knew the available options but also understood that those options weren't enough. And he had the credibility necessary to persuade a hidebound institution to change quickly. ''It's hard to say that the Fed has accomplished what could have or should have been accomplished,'' said Michael Woodford, an economist at Columbia University. ''Yet in the context of the difficulty of the challenges, the likelihood is that few other central bankers could have been as bold as Ben has been.'' Throwing Stuff at the Wall Mr. Bernanke was a rising star at Princeton in 1994 when he persuaded 953 people to elect him to a second job -- as a member of the Montgomery Township Board of Education. ''I did think he was a little crazy'' to add that second role, said Mark Gertler, a New York University economist who was a frequent academic collaborator with Mr. Bernanke during the 1990s. But the move was instead an early sign of Mr. Bernanke's restlessness with the theoretical world of academia and his nascent interest in public service. And the experience helped to prepare him for larger things. For six years, he spent several nights a month in the library of the local high school, usually dressed in a sport coat with elbow patches, calmly contributing to heated debates about building new schools in his rapidly growing community. ''When I met him he was shy and awkward,'' Professor Gertler said. ''It developed his ability to moderate meetings and interact with people.'' It is obligatory to say that Ben Shalom Bernanke was born in 1953 in Augusta, Ga., was raised in one of the few Jewish families in the small town of Dillon, S.C., and went to Harvard at the urging of friends despite the uneasiness of his parents. But the trajectory of his adult life really began to take shape at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his doctoral adviser, Stanley Fischer, introduced him to the work of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz on the causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s. In Mr. Bernanke's Fed office hangs an old photograph of four central bankers who, through their failures in office, helped to make that depression so great. Mr. Fischer also inculcated the view that government, in moderation, could improve economic outcomes -- a pragmatic middle ground in the wars between the Keynesian belief in active management and the hands-off absolutism of rational expectations theory. Mr. Bernanke is a pragmatist by nature. A baseball fan, he cheered for the Boston Red Sox until the Nationals came to Washington in 2005. He now attends Nationals games regularly. In 2002, when Glenn Hubbard, then chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, called to gauge his interest in becoming one of the Fed's seven governors, Mr. Bernanke jumped at the chance. He had expected to be an ''academic lifer'' -- he still seems most comfortable when talking with college students -- but he found that he liked the practical challenges and potential impact of public service. After his nomination was announced, he sent an e-mail to some former colleagues on the school board, according to Laurie Navin, one of the recipients. Mr. Bernanke related that President Bush had asked him whether he had ever served in an elected position. ''It may mean nothing here, but I served on my local school board,'' Mr. Bernanke said he told the president. ''And Bush said: 'It's good enough for me. You're in.' '' Three years later, Mr. Bush made Mr. Bernanke the first modern Fed chairman who had ever held elective office. In his public speeches during his time as a governor, Mr. Bernanke gave a two-year master class on monetary policy, reinforcing the perception that he had the intellectual heft to succeed Mr. Greenspan. But Mr. Bernanke won the job in part by impressing Mr. Bush in a different way, according to people briefed on the selection process. During a brief stint in the White House as an economic adviser, Mr. Bernanke had distinguished himself by his willingness to answer the president's questions by saying, ''We don't really know, but here's how I think about it.'' As the financial system began to fall apart on his watch, it became clear that Mr. Bernanke had other valuable qualities: an ability to remain calm under pressure and a deep historical understanding of economic crises. Shortly after joining the Fed in 2002, he promised Mr. Friedman and Ms. Schwartz that the central bank would not repeat its mistakes of the 1930s. ''You're right, we did it,'' he said at the time. ''We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.'' Now he urged his colleagues and staff members to set aside their habitual care and find new ways for the Fed to pump money into the financial system. Mr. Bernanke sometimes invoked President Franklin D. Roosevelt's marching orders to throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what stuck. ''We rolled out 12 new products in 12 months,'' recalled the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who worked closely with Mr. Bernanke during the crisis period. ''The Federal Reserve hadn't rolled out a single new product in a generation. But he said the Fed had to operate fundamentally differently to get through this. Because Ben was in some ways the dean of the academy in monetary policy, he realized how little we knew.'' Mr. Bernanke said later that the crisis in the fall of 2008 was ''the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.'' He had not seen it coming; he had done nothing to soften the initial impact. But he kept his promise to Mr. Friedman and Ms. Schwartz. It was a monumental achievement. It was also incomplete. Almost eight million Americans had lost their jobs. Constrained by Reality There was a time when Mr. Bernanke seemed to know exactly how a central bank should jolt a country out of an economic malaise. In a swaggering 1999 paper, he accused Japan's central bank of lacking the will to take obvious steps to revive that nation's economy. One prescription, which earned him the nickname ''Helicopter Ben,'' was that the Bank of Japan should agree to offset a large tax cut by buying an equivalent amount of government debt, a strategy that Mr. Bernanke compared to a ''helicopter drop of newly printed money.'' The point, which he repeated at his first meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in 2002, was that central banks had plenty of ways to stimulate growth even after flooring the gas by cutting short-term rates to zero. ''I'm not one who worries about zero bounds,'' Mr. Bernanke declared. Yet in the five years since the Bernanke Fed hit that zero bound in December 2008, it has not taken the drastic steps that Mr. Bernanke recommended to Japan. Instead, it has relied on two of what Mr. Bernanke once described as the least potent options available to a central bank: declaring that the Fed intends to keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment declines, and ''quantitative easing'' -- buying large quantities of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to accelerate job growth. ''During the crisis, it was clear that they were pulling out all of the stops to try to find a solution, and once the financial system stabilized and the problem was merely 10 percent unemployment, then they moved more slowly,'' said Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, who wrote in a 2012 paper that Mr. Bernanke has lacked the courage of his convictions. Mr. Bernanke has said that critics misunderstand the context of his writings. He was arguing that central banks always have the power to prevent deflation, as the Fed has done in recent years. He did not initially embrace the idea that the Fed should act with comparable force to spur job creation. That case was made by others, including Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who called for officials to act as if their hair were on fire. But even as he grew increasingly concerned about unemployment, and pressed for stronger action, friends and colleagues say Chairman Bernanke found himself constrained in ways that Professor Bernanke did not anticipate, and that his academic critics still don't seem to appreciate: by political realities, internal opposition and a heightened awareness of consequences. Several of his most potent prescriptions, like the helicopter drop, require the cooperation of fiscal authorities. But Congress in recent years has shown little interest in helping to stimulate the economy. Instead, the Fed's efforts have been undermined by repeated rounds of federal spending cuts. The Fed has also struggled to anticipate those cuts -- one reason that its stimulus campaign was only slowly expanded to its present scale. Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged that the Fed did not do enough in the first years after the crisis. Perhaps most important, internal resistance has increased with each expansion of the Fed's stimulus campaign as officials fret that the economic benefits are shrinking even as the chances increase that something will go wrong. ''He came in as a brilliant academic -- a very smart guy with a very deep background in monetary economics -- but it was as an academic,'' said Donald Kohn, who served as the Fed's vice chairman under Mr. Bernanke until 2010. ''And one of the things that necessarily happens to you when academic theory meets the real world is you become more aware of the limitations of the theory and the models and how you need to operate in the real world that may not function the way your models suggest that it should function.'' Mr. Kohn added that, in his view, Mr. Bernanke rose to these challenges. Last autumn, after months of quiet campaigning, Mr. Bernanke won support for two experiments that made job creation the clear focus of Fed policy. The Fed announced in September that it would buy $40 billion a month in mortgage bonds until the labor market outlook improved ''substantially.'' In December, it said it would hold short-term rates near zero at least so long as the jobless rate remained above 6.5 percent. Mr. Bernanke spoke of the Fed's ''grave concern'' about unemployment, a problem that he said should concern every American. But many of the officials who supported the program did so tentatively, and their growing unease drove the decision for Mr. Bernanke to announce in June that the Fed intended to reduce its bond-buying before the end of the year. Central Bank Straight Talk On an unusually warm day in January 2012, Mr. Bernanke walked into a room filled with reporters, sat down behind a desk dressed with the Fed board of governors seal and announced that the Fed wanted inflation to be about 2 percent a year -- the first time the Fed had detailed its economic objectives so specifically. It was a moment of his own construction. For two decades, he had been perhaps the foremost proponent of the idea that central banks could increase the power of their actions by speaking clearly about their intentions. As a member of the board of governors, he argued publicly for the Fed to adopt an inflation target despite the opposition of Mr. Greenspan, the powerful chairman, who believed that talking about the future would constrain the Fed's flexibility. Mr. Greenspan had quickly marginalized other academics sent to the Fed to counterbalance his dominance, but his impending retirement made it necessary to talk about other ways of running the Fed, and Mr. Bernanke carefully presented his approach as a method of bottling Mr. Greenspan's magic. That was merely politic. Mr. Bernanke believed that making the Fed more predictable would improve its performance. He wanted it to spend more time operating on autopilot. He wanted to reduce the chairman's importance. ''The thing I think he'll be known for, if it lasts, is depersonalizing the institution,'' Professor Gertler said. ''The idea is that the Fed has a systematic response to the economy. It's not the hunch of the chairman; it's communicating to the public clear rules of thumb for monetary policy.'' Yet by the time Mr. Bernanke was able to achieve his goal, his purpose had changed. Stabilizing inflation, which he described in his first speech as Fed chairman as the primary goal of monetary policy, no longer seemed enough. Indeed, announcing the target seemed to make it easier for the Fed to suggest that it wouldn't mind if inflation rose a little above 2 percent during its campaign to spur job creation. Paradoxically, by emphasizing communication through innovations like regular news conferences, which he introduced in April 2011, Mr. Bernanke in some ways increased the chairman's role rather than submerging it in the institution. And the emphasis on transparency remains more popular with academics than with policy makers whose roots are in the markets. Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, has argued that transparency can encourage investors to become overconfident about the path of policy, resulting in undue risk-taking, basically because people aren't very good at minding the difference between a forecast and a promise. When Mr. Bernanke sought earlier this year to shake some speculative excess from financial markets by announcing that the Fed intended to reduce the volume of its bond purchases, some argued that he was being forced to fix a
problem created by his own communications policy. ''I think transparency in central banking is kind of like truth-telling in everyday life,'' Mr. Bernanke said in response. ''You've got to be consistent about it.'' In the weeks after his initial remarks, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials made the same points over and over again until they felt that they had been heard. If the Fed pulled back later this year, they said, it would be doing so only because it was finally starting to achieve its goals. 'I'm Sure You'll Miss Us' Mr. Bernanke told The New York Times in the spring of 2010 that he had accepted a second term as Fed chairman for two reasons. ''First I wanted to see through the process of financial regulatory reform, which will have long-lasting impacts on our economy,'' he said. ''Second, I felt that I could play a useful role in managing the exit from our extraordinary policies, including our highly accommodative monetary policies.'' As he prepares to step down, the work of regulatory reform is a long way from finished and the Fed's exit remains entirely in the future. Nonetheless, Mr. Bernanke is already starting to let the weight of the last eight years slip from his shoulders. In June, he delivered a lighthearted baccalaureate address at Princeton, looking more comfortable wearing medieval robes in a Gothic chapel than he has often looked in new suits. ''I wrote recently to inquire about the status of my leave from the university,'' he joked, ''and the letter I got back began, 'Regrettably, Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can accommodate.' '' In July, Mr. Bernanke did not bother suppressing a snort of laughter when a senator, thanking him for his service at what may well have been his last Congressional hearing as the Fed chairman, added, ''And I'm sure you'll miss us.'' And, this past week, he skipped the annual late-summer gathering of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he had spoken in each previous year of his chairmanship. ''It really seemed that the burden of dealing with the crisis, just the way he would carry himself when you would see him, it looked like a tremendous weight,'' Professor Woodford said of Mr. Bernanke. ''And I hope that either because the economy recovers or he can hand off his job to someone else, I'm hoping that he does indeed become much more lighthearted again.'' And who knows? Someday, he might even be able to sell his town house for a profit.There was ample attention in journalistic circles as Al Jazeera America had its premiere on Tuesday -- particularly among those who could not watch. The news channel -- which replaced Current TV at 3 p.m. Eastern time -- was expected to be carried by five of the country's 10 biggest television providers, but one of those, AT&T U-verse, dropped Current, and thus Al Jazeera, late Monday night. That decision irritated some U-verse subscribers, who complained online about the company's move and which further limited Al Jazeera America's potential audience on Day 1. On Tuesday evening, Al Jazeera said it was looking to the court system to resolve the contract dispute. ''Unfortunately AT&T's decision to unilaterally delete Al Jazeera America presented us with circumstances that were untenable -- an affiliate that has willfully and knowingly breached its contractual obligations," the broadcaster said in a statement. "We had no choice but to take this action and to enforce Al Jazeera's rights under its agreement with AT&T -- and to compel AT&T to do the right thing.'' The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, accuses AT&T of wrongful termination and seeks restoration of the channel as well as damages. AT&T said it had not yet seen the lawsuit. In a statement, it hinted that Current's transformation into Al Jazeera gave it an opening to drop the channel: ''As a result of our inability to come to terms on a new agreement and due to certain breaches of the existing agreement, we have decided not to carry Current TV on U-verse.'' People who were curious about the new channel but were not able to access it on TV found that they could not access it online, either. It is not being live-streamed on the Internet, much to the disappointment of a small but vocal group of longtime Al Jazeera viewers in the United States. Those fans had grown accustomed to watching the pan-Arab broadcaster's existing English-language news channel, called Al Jazeera English, via the Internet. But on Monday, Al Jazeera English turned off its live stream for users in the United States. It also started to geo-block the news reports it posts on YouTube, so that instead of seeing the videos, American users saw a message that said, ''The uploader has not made this video available in your country.'' Al Jazeera officials said privately that in the run-up to the premiere of the new American channel, they had little choice but to acquiesce to cable and satellite providers, which generally discourage online competition of the kind that Al Jazeera English previously represented. In effect they have sacrificed Internet distribution for a shot at traditional distribution. Al Jazeera's decision made a certain amount of sense, considering that most Americans spend far more time with television than the Internet. Still, complaints about the blockade piled up on Al Jazeera America's Facebook page. One of the most-liked comments criticized the broadcaster for ''going backward'' by prioritizing TV over the Internet. The concerns were shared by some Al Jazeera staff members, especially those who have been at Al Jazeera English, or A.J.E. for short, for years. The live stream and the YouTube page were the main ways their work was seen in the United States until the restrictions were put in place this week. The staff's complaints were channeled by Rob Reynolds, an A.J.E. correspondent based in Los Angeles, who wrote on Facebook on Monday that ''the great blackout has begun.'' ''Al Jazeera is now blocking all A.J.E. videos from the U.S.A.,'' Mr. Reynolds wrote. ''It's a form of corporate censorship that would make the Chinese Politburo jealous. And an incredible show of disrespect to all the reporters operating in the U.S. who have helped build Al Jazeera's brand name in this country.'' Mr. Reynolds deleted the Facebook post, but not before other Al Jazeera staff members saw it and shared it with each other approvingly. Reached on Tuesday, Mr. Reynolds said the post was intended for family and friends and was written out of frustration. He deleted it, he said, because he concluded that it was unfair to his colleagues. He said his reference to censorship was aimed at the cable and satellite providers, not his employer. Mohamed Nanabhay, the former head of Al Jazeera English's Web site, pointed out in an e-mail message that there were thousands of Al Jazeera videos ''embedded on third-party sites across the Internet that have suddenly become unavailable to audiences'' because of the blockade. Mr. Nanabhay said Al Jazeera America could have gone in a different direction and tried to appeal to the growing number of Americans dissatisfied with cable, the so-called cord-cutters who access video online. A spokesman for Al Jazeera did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but the head of social media for the new channel, Riyaad Minty, hinted about a possible solution. To those ''who have lost the live streams,'' he wrote on Twitter, ''We hear you. We're working on it.'' The new American channel was supposed to be available in about 48 million homes, according to Nielsen. The loss of U-verse reduces that to around 45 million. Still, that is a decent start for a new channel: many other now-successful cable channels, including Fox News and MSNBC, started in fewer homes. On Tuesday, Al Jazeera America was available to some subscribers of Comcast, DirecTV, Dish Network, and Verizon FiOS. The biggest provider that is not yet carrying the new channel, Time Warner Cable, said it remained in negotiations about possibly carrying it in the future. As for the channel itself, when it started Tuesday afternoon, it seemed to deliver on what it promised -- serious, straightforward news. The first hour had a lengthy promotional video that said, among other things, ''We will connect the world to America, and Americans to the world.'' Then, at 4 p.m., the news began, led by the former CNN anchor Tony Harris, who updated viewers on the unrest in Egypt and a shooting at a school in Georgia. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.The Russian state oil company, Rosneft, intends to sign a major contract to supply China with more than $60 billion of crude oil, a deal that could signal a small shift away from Western Europe toward Asia. Russia has been gradually opening its oil spigot to China in recent years. While the overall volume of Russia's oil output has remained level, the country has decreased sales to recession-plagued Europe. ''Without any exaggeration a large-scale contract has been prepared by Rosneft,'' said President Vladimir V. Putin said after a meeting on Thursday with China's vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Supplies to China are expected to reach ''volumes of hundreds of millions of tons of oil, in total worth more than $60 billion'' Mr. Putin said, though he provided no further details about the hefty contract. Even a modest shift could have a significant effect on Europe, raising prices across the region. Russia is now the largest oil producer in the world, pumping about 10 million barrels a day, slightly more than Saudi Arabia. Currently, Russia exports about a fifth of its oil output to Asia. It pipes oil directly to China after a trans-Siberian pipeline was completed in 2010 that overcame decades of tension along the long and remote border between Siberia and Manchuria. Mr. Putin told Mr. Zhang that he hopes two Russian gas companies, Gazprom and Novatek, will similarly strike deals to export energy to China. Energy analysts said Rosneft has also been negotiating with Chinese companies to form joint ventures to drill in the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean above eastern Siberia, after granting similar deals to Exxon Mobil, Eni of Italy and the Norwegian oil company Statoil to drill in the Kara Sea, an inlet on the western side of the long coastline. The Rosneft deal would become the latest in a series of financial transactions between Russian energy companies and China. Rosneft first took a loan of $6 billion from Chinese state banks as prepayment for oil exports in 2005. The company, in turn, used the money to finance its takeover of the largest production unit of Yukos oil company, after the imprisonment of the founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, an episode criticized by Western governments but not the Chinese. In 2009, Chinese banks lent $25 billion to Rosneft and the state oil pipeline monopoly, Transneft, to complete the trans-Siberian pipeline, called the East Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline. Under the terms of the deal, the banks would be repaid with 2.5 billion barrels of oil exported to China over 20 years from 2010 until 2030. Both sides have benefited. The volume of oil amounted to 4 percent of China's oil demand over that period. On the Russian side, the loan helped stabilize Russia's balance of payments crisis in the recession that began in 2008. The latest Chinese deal will most likely allow the Russian government to delay a planned privatization of 19 percent of Rosneft's shares, which faced political opposition. It also suggests closer financial ties with China, which could help Russia weather its current economic slump.ECONOMIC REPORTS Data to be released this week includes the ISM manufacturing index for May, construction spending for April and domestic car and truck sales for May (Monday); United States trade deficit figures for April (Tuesday); the ADP jobs report for May, the ISM purchasing manager index for May, factory orders for April and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book (Wednesday); weekly initial jobless claims (Thursday); and federal unemployment figures for May (Friday).

The data from the National Bureau of Statistics gave the latest sign of a gathering rebound in activity in China, the world's second-largest economy after that of the United States. The December increase in profits to $143.91 billion was smaller than the 22.8 percent increase in November but still marked the third-fastest growth last year. Industrial profits totaled 5.56 trillion renminbi in 2012, up 5.3 percent from a year earlier, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said on its Web site. That was up from a 3 percent increase in the first 11 months of 2012, compared with 2011. The Chinese economy grew at a rate of 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, snapping a streak of seven consecutive quarters of slowdown. Among 41 sectors surveyed by the bureau, 29 reported rising profits last year, led by a 69 percent jump for power generation companies, a nearly 21 percent increase for food processing companies and an 8 percent rise for makers of electrical equipment. But some sectors are still struggling. Profits at steel companies tumbled 37 percent, while earnings for chemical companies fell 6 percent. According to a Reuters poll, analysts predict that China's annual economic growth will rebound slightly to 8.1 percent this year. The HSBC flash purchasing managers' index this month, the earliest indicator of China's industrial activity, showed growth in the factory sector accelerating to a two-year high in January. Volvo's China joint venture Volvo of Sweden said it would surpass Daimler as the world's biggest maker of heavy trucks after agreeing to set up a venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group, Reuters reported from Beijing. Volvo will pay 5.6 billion renminbi for a 45 percent stake in the joint venture, giving it access to China, where it currently has only a minor presence. The truck maker is a separate company from Volvo Cars, which Ford Motor sold to Geely Automobile of China in 2010. China was ''a little bit of a missing link in our global strategy'' for trucks, Volvo's chief executive, Olof Persson, said in a conference call with analysts and journalists. He said the agreement meant Volvo would ''get a major foothold and share in the world's largest truck market.'' The two companies will form a new venture, Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles, after the Chinese company buys out Nissan Motor of Japan in their joint venture in medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Dongfeng is the world's second-largest producer of heavy-duty trucks and China's biggest with total sales of 186,000 in 2011.DETROIT -- When automakers rolled out their new electric cars three years ago, they had big plans. Even President Obama, in his State of the Union address in 2011, predicted there would be as many as a million of them on the nation's roads by the middle of the decade. Results have, so far, fallen way short of expectations. Only about 36,000 battery-powered vehicles were sold this year through July, according to the auto research site Edmunds.com. And many of those sales were spurred by heavy discounts from car companies desperate to move electric models off the lot. But for hybrid cars, it has been a different story. Automakers have sold about 298,000 hybrids, which alternately run on gasoline engines and battery power, so far this year. And while electric vehicles may be considered greener and more glamorous, hybrids have quietly entered the mainstream of the American auto market. Today, more than 40 conventional hybrid models are available, from mass-market automakers like Toyota and Ford to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes. Hybrids account for about 3 percent of overall industry sales, with the market-leading Toyota Prius cracking the Top 10 list of best-selling passenger cars. By contrast, automakers offer only about a dozen all-electric cars or plug-in models -- which run on battery power with assistance from a gasoline engine -- although more are on the way. Industry analysts say that hybrid models are now showing up on the shopping lists of a broad range of consumers. ''Conventional hybrids are mainstream now,'' said John O'Dell, the green-car editor at Edmunds. ''You can envision almost anyone buying one.'' The reasons are many. Hybrids cost less than most electric models. There are no limitations on driving range based on battery power. And the technology, once seen as exotic and possibly unreliable, has been proved over time in real-world driving conditions. One of the hybrid converts is Pandian Athirajan, an I.B.M. product manager in Austin, Tex. He had been considering buying a Prius for years before finally taking the plunge in May. He bought the Prius to save gas and reduce vehicles emissions, but only because its hybrid system had been perfected by Toyota since it was introduced in 2000. ''I wanted to buy a third-generation hybrid so that all kinks were ironed out,'' Mr. Athirajan said. For many consumers, price is the biggest factor in choosing a hybrid over a vehicle that runs primarily on battery power, though a $7,500 federal tax credit is available for plug-in models and all-electric cars. For example, the base price for a regular, gasoline-powered Ford Fusion sedan is $21,900. The conventional hybrid version of the car goes for $26,200. But the plug-in variation costs $38,700. Faced with sluggish demand for electric vehicles, auto companies have increasingly been forced to slash prices to stimulate demand. Ford, for example, recently cut $4,000 from the price of its all-electric Focus. Manufacturers are also fighting an uphill battle to win over consumers worried about the distances they can travel before recharging an a purely electric car. That was one reason Mr. Athirajan chose a hybrid. Even though his hometown has several public charging stations, including one at his local Walmart, Mr. Athirajan was concerned about making the 300-mile drive to Houston twice a month to visit his daughter. Mr. Athirajan said he was prepared to look into buying an electric vehicle in three or four years but that he thought the electric technology still needed to mature. He also said that four to six hours to charge the battery was too long. ''Most of the E.V. cars give anywhere between 75 to 125 miles between charge,'' Mr. Athirajan said. ''It will be O.K. for weekday office trips but not O.K. for weekend shopping and other trips, and definitely not suitable for my weekend trips to Houston.'' Despite the lukewarm acceptance of electric models, automakers are nevertheless pushing ahead with more of them. One critical consideration is the increasingly stringent fuel-economy rules set by the federal government, which mandate that a car company's total fleet must average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly double what it is today. The pressure is even more acute in California, which has a zero-emission-vehicle program intended to cut pollution and increase sales of electric cars. Chrysler, which is controlled by the Italian automaker Fiat, recently acknowledged that it would sell an electric version of the Fiat 500 minicar specifically to comply with California requirements. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both Fiat and Chrysler, made a rare admission that his companies were willing to lose money on the vehicle as long as it helped them adhere to fuel-economy rules. Analysts like Mr. O'Dell said the fuel and emissions standards possibly forced automakers to introduce electric vehicles before there was actual demand for them. ''It might have been better to continue improving conventional hybrids and do more plug-in vehicles first,'' he said. Still, car companies are continuing to invest heavily in all facets of alternative-fuel vehicles. Ford is spending about $400 million to design parts for electrified models and increasing its research into higher capacity batteries. General Motors considers the plug-in Chevrolet Volt an important product in its lineup, but acknowledges that it has been a challenge to gain wide consumer acceptance. Last year, it cut production and this summer reduced the price by $4,000 in addition to offering more favorable lease terms to stimulate demand. Nissan, which makes the all-electric Leaf, said it remained committed to the car. ''Nissan's priority is to make Leaf the first affordable, mass-market, zero-emission vehicle,'' a Nissan spokesman, Brian Brockman, said. Tesla, which makes an all-electric car, has had solid sales catering to the highest end of the market. Analysts say that the public's tepid response to electric vehicles, and the embrace of hybrids, is typical of the way people adopt new technology. ''They all come onto the market very slowly and then begin to accelerate,'' said Philip G. Gott, senior director at IHS Automotive. ''Hybrids are beginning to accelerate.'' Leading that growth is the Prius. Toyota's decision to expand the Prius lineup to three hybrid models, along with a plug-in model, has been a big part of the company's comeback in the United States from recalls linked to sudden acceleration issues. In July, Prius sales jumped 40 percent, to 23,294 -- which includes only 817 plug-ins -- and it was the 12th best-selling vehicle in the United States. Toyota, which offers 11 hybrid models, including its Lexus brand, said that being first to the market helped the Prius remain the best-selling hybrid. The Prius accounts for about 70 percent of hybrids sold. ''It wasn't an overnight success,'' a Toyota spokeswoman, Jana Hartline, said. ''It was considered by many to be a science experiment. I think it just took people a while to understand the benefits of hybrid technology, but now it's pretty clear that there's no compromise on the part of the consumer. You just get in, turn it on and drive.'' Toyota plans to offer 18 new or redesigned hybrid models by 2015 to expand its reach. David Blum, a graphic designer from Lake Elsinore, Calif., bought a Prius last month to replace the older model he has driven since 2005. He originally purchased the Prius to take advantage of the incentives offered by California, including tax credits and a sticker that allows him to drive in the state's car pool lanes. ''I got used to the mileage, and it was difficult to go back to a gasoline engine,'' Mr. Blum said. ''When you get 40 to 50 miles to the gallon, it just becomes the normal.'' He said he would not buy an electric car because the price was high and he would need to install a charging station in his garage. ''There is not yet an affordable electric option with enough range to make it viable,'' he said.DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that its net income rose 19 percent in the second quarter, to $1.2 billion, as it reported record sales in North America and Asia and reduced losses in Europe. Ford surpassed analysts' expectations by reporting global revenue of $38.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Pretax operating profit was $2.6 billion, up $726 million. Strong sales in North America continued to carry the company as it lost money in Europe and restructured its operations there and invested heavily in China. It was the 16th consecutive profitable quarter for Ford. Ford said its market share grew in its four crucial global markets: Europe, South America, Asia Pacific Africa and North America, where it grew nearly a full percentage point to 16.5 percent. ''Our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world,'' Alan R. Mulally, the company's president and chief executive, said in a statement. Ford's shares rose 2.5 percent to close at $17.37. The record sales in North America, as well as the gradually improving European market, prompted Ford to raise its full-year outlook, which now calls for pretax profit to equal or surpass 2012. ''We've already blown past what we did last year,'' Robert L. Shanks, chief financial officer, told reporters at Ford's headquarters here. The automaker reported a pretax loss of $348 million in Europe but said that was an improvement from both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Ford said it expected to lose $1.8 billion in Europe this year, less than the $2 billion it had previously projected. Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars, also reported improvement in Europe, with net income more than doubling from the period a year ago. Ford's European market share increased this quarter to 8.1 percent from 7.6 percent, a significant development ''because the industry is down, and our retail share is up in a down industry,'' a company spokesman, Jay Cooney, said. Ford managed to increase its market share in Europe with the introduction of new models of the Kuga small utility vehicle, the Ranger pickup and B-Max compact crossover, Mr. Shanks said. ''I think the industry is still under a dark cloud because, as a whole, it still hasn't taken out the excess capacity there,'' Mr. Shanks said. In Europe, Ford said it would focus on retail sales at the expense of the fleet market, and expected to bolster its bottom line after closing two plants in Britain this week and another, in Genk, Belgium, late next year. In the Asia Pacific region and China, in particular, Ford said it recorded its highest pretax profit of any quarter. Over all, the region's pretax profit was $177 million, in contrast to a $66 million loss in the second quarter last year. Market share grew one percentage point, to 3.6 percent. Ford also reported that its market share in China surged to 4.3 percent, from 2.8 percent, its best quarterly figure there ever. The automaker is investing heavily in China, adding jobs, plants and new vehicle models. Ford introduced three small to medium-size utility vehicles during the first four months of the year, and plans to introduce five plants, add 300 dealerships and double its work force by 2015. South America also returned to profitability, fueled by the popularity of the Ranger and EcoSport models, Mr. Shanks said. Pretax profits there totaled $151 million, compared with $5 million last year. Ford's market share grew slightly to 9.6 percent, from 9.4 percent. The quarter's results also prompted Ford to raise its expectations for sales in the United States, Europe and China this year. It projects that the industry is on track to sell 15.5 million to 16 million vehicles in the United States. As a sign of this confidence in North America, Ford on Tuesday said it would hire 800 more salaried workers this year.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.  In the years just after the financial crisis -- 2010 and 2011 -- large American and European banks took drastically different courses. American banks raised a lot of capital. Many of the European ones did not. One result is that the American banks appear to have a competitive advantage. Being relatively well capitalized, they can afford to lend. That is less true in Europe. Keep that fact in mind as the debate goes on about the new capital rules that United States regulators proposed this week for the largest American banks, the ones with more than $700 billion in assets. Some of those banks will need to have a lot more capital in a few years than they have now if the proposed rules are not watered down. The banks were relatively restrained in their reactions this week, leaving it to trade groups to voice their complaints, which have a familiar ring to them. ''Ever-higher capital rules,'' warned Robert S. Nichols, the president of the Financial Services Forum, which includes 19 large financial companies, ''while a critically important element of safety and soundness, can become prohibitive and actually lead to reduced capability to lend to our nation's families and businesses at a time when the economic recovery remains fragile.'' That there are bank capital rules at all stems from the issues a country faces when it provides deposit insurance. Depositors have no reason to care whether the bank is healthy, so a risky bank is not at a competitive disadvantage. The problem gets worse when those who buy bonds issued by banks conclude that their investments are effectively guaranteed by the government. ''Banks have creditors who are not worried about risks,'' says Anat Admati, a Stanford finance professor and co-author of a book, ''The Bankers' New Clothes,'' that calls for tougher capital rules. ''If they were normal corporations, the creditors would not stand for it.'' It was never easy for regulators to determine how much capital was needed, but it became more difficult as financial innovations spread. That led to the 1988 adoption of model rules by a group of central banks and regulators that was based in Basel, Switzerland. That accord, later called Basel I, set up risk weightings for various types of assets, allowing for less capital for less risky assets. As the inadequacies of such a fixed system became clear, the regulators moved to one that allowed more fine-tuning, called Basel II. That allowed banks to use their own models -- or credit ratings from Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's -- to determine just how risky an asset was, and therefore how much capital was needed. ''Risk weighting is based on a very arcane, very complicated series of ratios and formulas that are immediately gamed and makes the system more fragile,'' Thomas M. Hoenig, the vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said this week after the F.D.I.C. voted to propose the new rules, along with other regulators. He said that the average risk weighting of bank assets fell, year after year, as the banks became better at coping with the rule. Those risk-weighted assets form the basis of the capital figures banks cite. If a bank has 5 percent capital, it means capital equals 5 percent of the assets after risk adjustments. Until recently, government bonds from European countries were zero weighted, meaning that they did not count at all. Collateralized debt obligations -- many of which turned out to be extremely risky -- had only a 7 percent weighting, Mr. Hoenig said. The result was that banks tended to load up on the highest-yielding assets with a given risk weighting. Because many mortgage securities had AAA ratings, that led banks as far away as Germany to lose a lot of money when the subprime mortgage market in the United States collapsed. Under the latest, post-crisis rules -- Basel III -- there is supposed to be a leverage test as a supplemental measure. That measurement counts capital as a percentage of all assets -- Treasury bills or junk bonds. The United States has long had such a test, though it was relatively lenient, but many other countries did not. This week's proposal says that very large banks -- the systemically important ones -- should maintain 6 percent leverage ratios, twice the 3 percent ratio that smaller banks are supposed to meet. That does not sound very high to some people. A 6 percent ratio means that a bank could have $16.67 in assets for every dollar of capital. Mr. Hoenig says he thought 10 percent would be a better number, and you have to wonder how many banks would lend to a normal company that was so highly leveraged. But in fact some big banks are much more leveraged, and they are not happy. They say privately that the higher leverage ratio would be more restrictive than the risk-weighted capital rules, giving them a perverse incentive to load up on risky assets. They say European banks are unlikely to face any such restriction, giving them a competitive advantage. That flies in the face of the current reality. Because they had less capital before the latest round of European problems, many banks there now need to raise more capital and, until they do it, are less able to make loans. The banks' problems are both a cause and a result of the continuing euro zone crisis. Having lower capital requirements can be a competitive advantage, but only if it turns out that the capital a bank has is adequate. The financial crisis led to widespread bailouts, but the details differed in ways that may have been critical. European banks did not leap to sell shares to investors in 2010 when markets opened up. But in the United States, having received a bailout became, as JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon put it, ''a scarlet letter.'' To repay the bailout, and avoid the stigma, banks sold new shares. The unpopularity of the bailout helped the banks. Now, some sort of leverage rule seems certain. Banks will push for a lower number, but they will also seek to change the way assets are counted. Under American accounting rules, banks can ignore some assets that do not show up on their balance sheet. The proposal would count more of those assets. Even worse, from the banks' point of view, the Basel committee last month put out a paper discussing changing the way some assets -- including credit-default swaps -- are counted. If those changes were made, asset totals at some banks counts could rise sharply, forcing the banks to keep more capital. When bankers talk about capital, they often use phrases like ''set aside,'' leaving the impression that a bank facing a 6 percent leverage ratio would have to immobilize 6 cents for every dollar lent. That is not an accurate image. A bank making a loan must bring in the cash somehow, whether from loans or from equity. Capital totals are based on the difference in values of a bank's assets and liabilities. What would be different with higher capital rules is that banks would issue less debt and more stock. Bankers think the cost of stock is higher, and so they warn they might have to charge more on loans. Stock is more expensive, if all goes well. It is less expensive if things go badly, because a shareholder whose dividend is not paid cannot force a bank into bankruptcy. A bondholder can do that. ''Increasing the amount of loss-absorbing capital in these institutions raises the overall financial stability of the system,'' Mr. Hoenig said in an interview. ''If they should have an unanticipated shock, they do not go into cardiac arrest as they did the last time and threaten the system.'' Years ago, the big banks would probably have been able to head off the coming fight, or to win it if the regulators tried to get tough. That the banks may not win this fight can be attributed to a couple of factors. One is that the regulators gave in on some issues affecting smaller banks, so the industry is not unified. The other is that regulators in the countries with the largest banking systems -- Britain and Switzerland as well as the United States -- are now acutely aware of the risks their countries face if big banks fail. For good reason, they are inclined to be cautious.  With the Affordable Care Act poised to make addiction treatment available to millions of new patients, the Betty Ford Center and the Hazelden Foundation, two of the biggest names in substance abuse recovery, are pursuing a formal business alliance, the two groups said Tuesday. The boards of both institutions have approved the alliance in principle, though neither group will so far divulge specifics of the plan. Hazelden has a network of 10 treatment centers throughout the country. Starting in 2014, Medicare and all insurance sold on Health Insurance Exchanges will be required to provide treatment for substance abuse under a provision of the Affordable Care Act.TAIPEI -- In the China smartphone market, Apple has seen better days. Despite having reported record sales of the iPhone 5, the U.S. technology giant's presence on the mainland flagged in 2012; it was pushed out of the top five smartphone makers in that market during the third quarter, with just 8 percent of the market, according to the research firm Canalys. As Coolpad, Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE surged ahead of Apple, a major force behind their success was MediaTek, a Taiwanese chip maker whose products have drastically reduced the cost for manufacturers of getting new phones to market. The company entered the smartphone business late, introducing its first chipset in 2011 inside a Lenovo phone. But within a year and a half, analysts say, MediaTek has taken 50 percent of China's market for smartphone chips. That success has come with the adoption of what MediaTek calls a ''turnkey solution.'' Rather than simply provide a chip, the company also offers instructions on how to build a phone, the software architecture to run it and dedicated consultants to advise phone makers through the production process. MediaTek's chief financial officer, David Ku, describes this as a franchise model in which all the clients have to do is ''turn on the burner.'' Peter Liao, an analyst at Nomura Securities who covers the industry, said MediaTek saved phone makers the often prohibitive cost of research and development. ''It typically takes a lot of money and time to develop a new handset model, but MediaTek comes in and provides a total solution,'' Mr. Liao said. The company has proved wildly popular among Chinese phone makers. Besides supplying Huawei, Lenovo and ZTE, MediaTek also supports lesser-known manufacturers, including those that make so-called bandit phones that imitate premium models from Apple, Samsung and HTC. TCL Communication Technology Holdings, a Chinese phone maker that sells phones primarily in Europe and Latin America, uses MediaTek's chips. Its chief operating officer, Wang Jiyang, said that when his company works with MediaTek, its only major design tasks are to make the software more user-friendly and to tailor the look and feel of the phone. ''In general, with MediaTek's help, we're able to achieve almost twice as fast time to market, compared to other solutions,'' Mr. Wang said. MediaTek was founded in 1997. It started out making chips for home entertainment electronics like DVD players and televisions before moving into components for CD and DVD-ROM devices. In 2004, it began making chips for small mobile phones. MediaTek estimates that it will lead the Chinese market by selling 110 million smartphone chips in 2012, up from 10 million chips a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm, the global leader in smartphone chips, is expected to finish 2012 in second place in China with 82 million chips shipped, according to the research firm DigiTimes. MediaTek has been powered by consumers like Zhang Ying, 31, who want to try the latest technology but not pay a premium for it. Mr. Zhang, a Shanghai resident, bought a knockoff HTC phone last year. ''Every person has a price point,'' he said. ''At a time when some of my friends were buying Samsung or iPhone, I wanted to show that I can keep up with them. A lot of domestic phones are cheap and of fairly good quality.'' People who think like Mr. Zhang are dominating sales, especially among first-time smartphone buyers. In a September report, McKinsey, the global consulting firm, estimated that 69 percent of all smartphones sold in China would cost less than 1,500 renminbi, or about $240, by the second half of 2013. And MediaTek is taking its business model to other emerging markets. The company's products support features that are popular in developing countries, like noise-reducing speakers and slots for two SIM cards. In India, local brands like Spice and Micromax are rolling out lower-priced smartphone models using MediaTek parts. In Brazil, phones by Motorola Mobility, as well as local brands like Gradiente and Multilaser, will also have MediaTek chips. ''The markets we target have 5.8 billion people, whereas the U.S. and Europe have less than one billion,'' said Mr. Ku of MediaTek. ''I need to aim at a global market, not just developed countries.'' MediaTek also released a chip last year for building basic smartphones that work in regions without mobile data networks. Users of these phones rely on Wi-Fi connections to download multimedia. These phones can cost as little as $50, or 312 renminbi. Those chips now account for 40 percent of MediaTek's smartphone chip sales, according to the company. Mark Hung, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, calls the network-less chip one of the ''fastest-growing smartphone segments,'' as many consumers are looking to switch from their simple mobile phones to basic, low-cost smartphones. ''This is a fairly new phenomenon, and as you can expect, mostly in emerging markets, including China,'' Mr. Hung said. For now, Apple has signaled that it has no intention of competing on price. The iPhone 5, released in China on Dec. 14, cost 300 renminbi more than the two previous models, the iPhone 4S and 4, on their release days. More than two million units of the iPhone 5 were sold during its first weekend. By contrast, Coolpad, Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE have rolled out new phones with similar performance at a third of the iPhone 5's price of 5,288 renminbi, and sometimes less. ''We believe that emerging countries should also be able to enjoy the use of information technology with the same computing power,'' said Tsai Ming-kai, chief executive of MediaTek. As the world's largest market for smartphones, China is quickly becoming a bellwether for the progress of sales wars globally. The Chinese experience may show that any leading market position can be fickle, and new brands can appear seemingly out of nowhere to capture significant market shares. Apple remains No. 2 in smartphone shipments worldwide after Samsung, but its position could be threatened as the competition expands to more consumers and more price points. ''Emerging economies are getting stronger,'' Mr. Tsai said. ''The industry dynamic is always evolving. Anything can happen.''3:55 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES - After some classic soap opera twists - union spats, outraged fans, squishy financing - a Hollywood production company, Prospect Park, on Monday confirmed that the canceled "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" would live on in cyberspace. For real this time. Prospect Park, run by Jeff Kwatinetz, said production would resume in February on the serial dramas, both of which ended epic runs in recent months after ABC decided the costly programs had dim futures. When new episodes will be made available - via theOnlineNetwork.com - is not clear. Mr. Kwatinetz and his business partner, Rich Frank, also declined to say which cast members might return. But Prospect Park has solved the union and financing problems that torpedoed the soap-saving effort after it was first announced last fall. The company on Monday confirmed that new agreements are in place with the major actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, and with the Directors Guild of America. The "necessary financing" is also set, as is the involvement of Agnes Nixon, the creator of both soaps. The Online Network also named three other senior executives.This is about more than saving soap operas, which have a relatively small but intensely loyal fan base. It is a bold bet that the Web - because of the proliferation of broadband, Internet-enabled TVs and the iPad - is now a practical way to funnel traditional shows to viewers. If the popularity of streamed 30-minute and 60-minute shows on Netflix and Hulu is any indication, consumers are ready to move beyond using the Web for bite-size video, Mr. Kwatinetz and Mr. Rich are gambling. "I know it's been a long journey, but the timing is actually fortuitous as TV viewing is evolving rapidly in our direction," Mr. Kwatinetz said in an interview. "The adoption of online TV in the last year has begun to move exponentially as viewers start to realize the immense advantages digital distribution affords. But all of that is unmatched compared to the relentless fan support. Since they didn't give up, either did we."

Verinata, based in Redwood City, Calif., sells a test that uses a blood sample from a pregnant woman to determine whether her baby will have Down syndrome or some other chromosomal abnormalities. Such tests, which have been available for only about a year, have been rapidly catching on as an alternative, in some situations, to invasive tests like amniocentesis that carry a slight risk of inducing a miscarriage. Illumina's stock fell almost 8 percent in early trading on Monday, though that was probably more because of reports that Illumina itself would not be acquired by Roche Holding, the Swiss pharmaceutical and diagnostics company. Illumina shares closed at $50.88, down 7 percent. Roche's chairman, Franz B. Humer, was quoted on Sunday by a Swiss newspaper, Sonntags Zeitung, as saying a deal was off because Illumina wanted too high a price. In April, Roche had dropped a hostile bid for Illumina, valued at $51 a share, or about $6.7 billion. But a different Swiss newspaper had reported in December that Roche was trying to buy Illumina again, this time for $66 a share. Neither Illumina nor Roche commented publicly on that report. Both Roche's interest in Illumina and Illumina's acquisition of Verinata suggest that DNA sequencing, which until now has mainly been used for research studies like the Human Genome Project, is moving toward being used for medical diagnosis. Illumina wants to be more than a seller of sequencing machines. It already offers a service sequencing the genomes of people to help diagnose rare diseases or figure out the best treatment for a cancer. In September, it bought BlueGnome, a British company that uses sequencing to screen for various genetic abnormalities. "The agreement with Verinata demonstrates Illumina's commitment to developing innovative diagnostic solutions and providing our partners with the most advanced technologies for improved patient care," Jay T. Flatley, chief executive of Illumina, said in a statement. Verinata's test, called Verifi, uses sequencing to analyze fragments of fetal DNA that can be found in a pregnant women's blood. That allows for detection of Down syndrome, in which a person has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. Such noninvasive tests for Down syndrome appear to be catching on rapidly. Verinata, however, is believed to substantially lag the market leader, Sequenom, in market share. Sequenom, a publicly traded company, introduced the first noninvasive Down syndrome test in October 2011. It said on Sunday that it had performed 60,000 of its MaterniT21 Plus tests in 2012, and by the end of the year was operating at an annualized run rate of 120,000 tests. Others selling or developing such tests include Ariosa Diagnostics and Natera. The companies are involved in various patent lawsuits against one another. They are also broadening their tests to detect chromosomal abnormalities beyond Down syndrome, including those linked to abnormalities in the sex chromosomes. Some of these other companies use Illumina sequencers to perform their tests. It is possible they may now become more reluctant to rely on machines made by a company that is a competitor. Illumina said there were about 500,000 high-risk pregnancies a year in the United States that would be candidates for a noninvasive prenatal test. It said the potential market for such tests would be more than $600 million in 2013. Verinata said on its Web site that it would continue to operate as a subsidiary of Illumina. Beyond the initial payment of $350 million, Verinata shareholders will be eligible to receive up to an additional $100 million in milestone payments through 2015. Illumina said the deal would dilute its earnings per share by 20 cents in 2013 but add to them in 2014. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Covington & Burling advised Illumina on the deal. Illumina made its announcement on the eve of the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, an annual Wall Street and medical industry gathering at which numerous companies make announcements. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Federal regulators on Monday reached an $8.5 billion settlement with 10 major lenders to resolve claims of foreclosure abuses, including the use of flawed paperwork and bungled loan modifications that may have led to wrongful evictions. The settlement, which includes the nation's largest lenders, like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, concludes weeks of negotiations between the banks and the federal regulators, led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It is intended to end a troubled foreclosure review of millions of loan files that was mandated by the banking regulators. Among the problems that came to light in the last several years were sloppy record-keeping and so-called robo-signing, in which foreclosures were made based on forged or unreviewed documents. Notably, four banks - Ally Financial, HSBC, OneWest Bank and Everbank - originally part of the negotiations, didn't sign onto the deal. Under the settlement, $3.3 billion in cash relief will go to borrowers who went through foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. The remaining $5.2 billion will be directed to homeowners in danger of losing their homes and will be used to reduce the amount of principal owed or the monthly payments, for example. Payments under the settlement, which covers 3.8 million households, could be as much as $125,000. Regulators said that borrowers would be contacted regarding relief by March 31. The pact, which was negotiated over the weekend, almost collapsed after officials from the Federal Reserve demanded that the banks pay an additional $300 million to address their part in the 2008 financial crisis, according to several people briefed on the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the end, the Federal Reserve agreed to back down after the banks threatened to torpedo the deal altogether. By signing on to the settlement, the 10 banks can resolve the outstanding chapter in their wrangling with federal banking regulators over foreclosure-related abuses. In February, five major mortgage servicers, all included in Monday's settlement, agreed to pay $26 billion under a separate deal with 49 state attorneys general, the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development after allegations arose in 2010 that bank employees were hastily plowing through documents used in foreclosure proceedings without properly reviewing them for accuracy. The latest foreclosure settlement was driven, to a large extent, by banking regulators, who decided that a mandatory review of loan files was inefficient, costly and simply not yielding relief for homeowners, the people briefed on the matter said. The goal in scuttling the reviews, which were mandated as part of a consent order in April 2011, was to provide more immediate relief to homeowners. The comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve said on Monday that the settlement "provides the greatest benefit to consumers subject to unsafe and unsound mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices during the relevant period in a more timely manner than would have occurred under the review process." Still, some housing advocates argued that while the settlement would supplant the flawed reviews, it did not go far enough in addressing the harm suffered by homeowners. "If the reviews had been done right the first time, banks would have been on the hook to pay far more to homeowners," said Alys Cohen, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center. Concerns about the effectiveness of the review process, known as the Independent Foreclosure Review, began to mount in December within the upper echelons of the comptroller's office, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Under the terms of the 2011 consent order, 14 banks had to hire independent consultants to analyze millions of loan records to spot any instances in which the banks might have improperly charged fees, denied loan modifications or wrongfully seized homes from borrowers current on their payments or making reduced monthly payments. Adding to the alarm, these people said, was that the reviews were taking more than 20 hours for every file, at a cost of up to $250 an hour. Since the start of the review, the banks have spent an estimated $1.5 billion to re-examine their foreclosure paperwork. Yet despite the huge bill, the reviews were not providing any relief to borrowers or turning up meaningful instances where homes of borrowers current on their payments were seized, according to these people. In a series of private meetings that began last month, regulators approached top bank executives to discuss the reviews. At those meetings, officials from the comptroller's office admitted the reviews were problematic and that the agency had "miscalculated" just how much energy and resources would be required to complete the reviews, according to the people with knowledge of the negotiations. Even though the officials acknowledged the flawed nature of the reviews, these people said, they used the loan reviews to propel a settlement with the banks. The threat, according to the people with knowledge of the negotiations, was that banks that did not sign onto the settlement would be forced to keep poring through loan files until the reviews naturally concluded. A majority of the banks, looking to move beyond the cumbersome reviews, agreed to the settlement. As talks heated up in the last week, regulators sent out e-mails to the consulting firms presiding over the reviews, according to two people with knowledge of the correspondence. The e-mails alerted the firms to begin dismantling the reviews. So far, roughly 495,000 people have submitted claims for their loan files to be reviewed, far fewer than the 3.8 million loans covered under the review. The relief will be distributed to homeowners even if they did not file a claim for their loan files to be reviewed.

Google has repeatedly made the argument -- and the commission agreed -- that the speed of change in the technology industry made it impossible for regulators to impose restrictions without stalling future innovations. Exhibit A is the mobile device. Nowhere has technology changed as rapidly and consumer behavior as broadly. As people abandon desktop computers for mobile ones, existing tech companies' business models are being upended and new companies are blooming. ''Mobile is very much a moving target,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of antitrust law at the University of Iowa who has been a paid adviser to Google. ''This is a market in which new competitors come in a week's time.'' When the commission began its investigation 19 months ago, for instance, the iPhone did not have the Siri voice search, Apple did not have its own mapping service and Yelp's mobile apps had no ads. By the time the inquiry concluded, all of that had changed. Google had new competitors on all sides trying to chip away at its hold on the mobile search and advertising market. Still, Google is even more dominant on mobile phones than on desktop computers. It has 96 percent of the world's mobile search market, according to StatCounter, which tracks Web use. It collects 57 percent of mobile ad revenue in the United States, while Facebook, its nearest competitor, gets just 9 percent, according to eMarketer. But, analysts say, as people change their search habits on mobile devices -- bypassing Google to go straight to apps like Yelp's, for example -- that dominance could wane, or a competitor could swoop in and knock Google off its perch. ''It's important to recognize that many mobile apps are really vertical search engines,'' said Rebecca Lieb, a digital media analyst at the Altimeter Group. ''It is impossible to really say anyone dominates a section of mobile in a secure way right now.'' On cellphones or tablets, for instance, people increasingly skip Google altogether in favor of apps like Flixster for movie times or Kayak for flights. Apple is taking on mobile search with Siri on the iPhone, which can answer questions about the weather or search for nearby restaurants. With its new mapping service, Apple has also entered local search. On Friday, Blekko, a search start-up, introduced an app called Izik for Apple and Android devices. It tries to make searching more tablet-friendly by showing images instead of just links, and making it easier to swipe through many pages of results with a finger. On mobile devices, said Rich Skrenta, chief executive of Blekko, ''the user experience is so different that we think it opens things up. On your desktop, if it doesn't look like Google, you think that's not a search engine. On a tablet, it's just vastly different.'' Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said at a news conference Thursday that the speed of change in the tech industry meant that ''you want to be careful before you apply sanctions.'' The commission also considered Google's partnerships with cellphone makers like Samsung and HTC that license Google search on phones, so that a search box shows up on the home screen. In the end it decided not to take action against Google. Some Google critics said that even though the competitive landscape is different on mobile devices, it should not have influenced the government's analysis of Google's behavior on the desktop Web. ''There's no doubt that mobile applications, including Yelp's, give consumers the ability to bypass the major search engines and go directly to the best provider of the service they're looking for,'' said Vince Sollitto, vice president for government relations at Yelp. Still, he added, ''I don't see how that impacts how someone is acting anticompetitively on the desktop.'' (One of Google's concessions to the federal agency, that it would allow other Web companies to ask Google not to show their content in its own vertical search products -- a chief complaint of Yelp's -- applies to mobile as well.) But others said antitrust enforcement in the 21st century needs to be more agile. ''It's no good if you have a 10-year investigation and then you say, 'They're guilty,' and the company is already dead,'' said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia who worked as an adviser to the commission until last summer, including on the Google case. One of the main targets of the commission's investigation was Google's practice of pulling information from the Web and showing it on search results pages, so people do not have to click on links to get what they want. Search for Barack Obama's birthday or the local weather, for instance, and Google shows you the answer above search results. That is even more important on mobile devices, where people do not have the space or patience to click on several links, said Amit Singhal, senior vice president for search at Google. Mobile apps, he added, require people to do extra work, opening one app to search for flights and another to find restaurants. ''Users end up acting as a mini search engine in today's world, which is not the best case,'' Mr. Singhal said. ''You should ask your phone or whatever device and get the answer, and that's the system we are working toward.'' Google has recently built new tools to try to give people answers more quickly. On Android phones, Google Now automatically shows information like local weather, airline flights or nearby restaurants without a search, and the Field Trip app shows information about nearby places. The latest Google search apps for Android and Apple devices let people search by talking, and then offer spoken answers. And Google now shows its so-called knowledge cards -- with answers to trivia questions or photos and details about people and places -- on mobile devices. Other companies are also trying to more seamlessly provide information on mobile devices. For example, it is easier and faster to book a table using the OpenTable app than it is to search for a restaurant on Google using a mobile browser, click on the link and then make a reservation. Even faster is asking Apple's Siri to book a table for you. ''The rate of speed at which mobile search is moving, you just have to out-innovate everyone else,'' Mr. Singhal said. ''That's the only way you win.''BEIJING -- In September, the largest factory in Yantai, a coastal city in northeastern China, called on the local government with a problem -- a shortage of 19,000 workers as the deadline on a big order approached. Yantai officials came to the rescue, ordering vocational high schools to send students to the plant, which is run by Foxconn Technology Group, a major supplier to some of the world's electronics giants, including Apple, Dell and Amazon, among others. As companies like Foxconn shift factories away from higher-cost production bases in China, like the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong Province, they are discovering that workers in new locations across China are not as abundant as they had expected. That has prompted multinationals and their suppliers to use millions of teenage students from vocational and technical schools on assembly lines. The schools teach a variety of trades and require work experience, which in practice means students must accept work assignments to graduate. In any given year, at least eight million vocational students work on China assembly lines and in workshops, according to estimates from the Ministry of Education -- about one in eight Chinese 16 to 18 years old. In 2010, the ministry ordered vocational schools to fill any shortages in the work force. The country's minimum legal working age is 16. Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, is based in Taiwan and is a major supplier of smartphones, computers and videogame equipment to electronics companies around the world. It employs 1.2 million workers across China. Nearly 3 percent are student interns. The company ''has a huge appetite for workers,'' Wang Weihui, vice director of the Yantai Fushan Polytechnic School, told a reporter recently. ''It tightens the labor market,'' said Mr. Wang, whose school sends its students to work at Foxconn and other companies. Local governments eager to please new investors lean on schools to meet shortfalls in the number of workers. That is what Yantai, in Shandong Province, did in September when Foxconn had trouble filling Christmas orders for Nintendo's Wii game consoles. ''It has been easier to recruit workers in the Pearl River Delta than some inland locations,'' Foxconn said in a written statement in late December. Some companies cite rising wages in southern China for the shift to other regions. Wages are a growing component of overall manufacturing costs in China, totaling as much as 30 percent of production costs, depending on the industry, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Wages began to rise around 2006 as the migration of rural workers to Guangdong ebbed. China's one-child policy, plus a jump in higher education enrollment, further depleted the number of new entrants to the work force, pushing wages up further. That prompted U.S. carmakers, Korean electronics manufacturers and private Chinese firms to look for new manufacturing bases. Cheaper electricity, land and tax incentives, as well as a growing consumer class in regions beyond the booming coastal southern provinces were other reasons to relocate. Minimum wages in Yantai can be as low as 1,100 renminbi, or $180, a month, compared with 1,500 renminbi in Shenzhen, the city neighboring Hong Kong. What makes vocational students attractive is that they can be paid less than full-time workers, although some companies -- including Foxconn -- pay the same base wages. Still, even if they pay the same base salary to both full-time staff members and interns, employers can save 10 percent to 40 percent per person because legally they do not have to pay health insurance or social security benefits for student interns. Yantai was not the only local government to help Foxconn. Two months earlier, Foxconn's 100,000-worker factory near the city of Zhengzhou, in Henan Province, was racing to meet a deadline for the Apple iPhone 5. The Henan authorities told cities to find 30,000 more workers for Foxconn, according to a Zhengzhou city government notice reprinted by Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, a labor rights group based in Hong Kong. The example of Yantai shows how much China's labor market has changed in recent years. Zhang Weifang, head of human resources at the Yantai factory of LG Innotek, estimates the number of employable people 16 to 18 years old in the city has halved since her company began production in 2004. LG Innotek is the components unit of LG Electronics of South Korea. ''It's really hard to find people nowadays,'' she said. About 2,400 young people work in Ms. Zhang's factory. Of them, one-third are vocational students or workers contracted through other agencies. Students are sought after by plants that need extra workers during peak production periods, and this demand has risen since China's labor laws were overhauled in 2008 to make firing full-time staff members more cumbersome. And students are plentiful. The number of graduates of vocational schools has surged 26 percent in the past five years, to 6.6 million students in 2011. Parents whose children cannot compete in exam-driven Chinese high schools look to vocational schools. Vocational students made up such a large percentage of the work force at a Honda plant in southern China that when they went on strike for better pay in 2010, they crippled Honda's production chain in the country. A Honda spokeswoman said the ratio of students to regular employees had since significantly declined, but she would not give a figure. About 2.7 percent of Foxconn's work force in China consists of vocational students, the company said in October. That works out to about 32,400 teenagers. ''This program gives Foxconn an opportunity to identify participants who have the potential to be excellent full-time employees, should they wish to join our company upon graduation,'' Foxconn said in a statement at the time. That month, the Chinese state media said 56 people younger than the legal working age were among students sent to work at Foxconn in Yantai. Foxconn removed the underage students from the plant after the reports. Chinese law limits students to eight hours of work a day, with no night shifts. Vocational students in Yantai said they had worked as many as 12 hours a day and routinely had done night shifts at both Chinese-owned factories and plants with foreign investors. Foxconn has a program with Apple, one of its main customers, to pay interns the same wages as other workers, limit their work to eight hours a day, five days a week and allow them to quit if they want to. More than a dozen students interviewed in Yantai had a mixed view of their internships, ranging from relatively positive to outraged. Many said the experience had taught them to look for something other than assembly line work after graduation. Most three-year vocational programs require a two-month internship in the second year, while the third is spent entirely at work. Even though students know they need factory experience to graduate, the assembly line comes as a shock to some. ''At the beginning I was really excited. I thought I could get experience and help out my family with some money,'' said a 17-year-old woman named Yu who was an intern in Yantai. A high school student, she was afraid publication of her full name could bring repercussions from her school or factory. ''To suddenly encounter 12-hour work shifts, standing, with only 40 minutes to rest and eat, our legs can't stand it,'' Yu said. Some students said they hoped the work would improve their prospects. ''Electronics is our major and so this will help in finding jobs,'' said Sun Chuangjiao, a former Foxconn intern. Companies defend the internships as educational. ''The vast majority of our interns and the schools that sponsor them find their experience with us relevant and meaningful and an important first step in their career development,'' a representative from Emerson Electronics said. At its air-conditioner compressor plant in the Yangtze Delta city of Suzhou, Emerson employs 40 interns for eight-month stints, out of a work force of 1,063. All are older than 18, it said. The shortage of labor means companies often search far and wide for vocational schools to supply workers. Ms. Zhang of LG Innotek said she had contacted schools across China to find interns. Mok Jangkyun, an auditor with Samsung Electronics, said he had driven a full day after flying to Guizhou Province in southwest China to vet a vocational school sending interns to supplier factories. Samsung did an audit of factories after activists found underage workers with fake identification at one of the electronics giant's 250 supplier factories in China. The South Korean company said it had not found underage workers at any of its suppliers. Supplying vocational students can also be lucrative. Some students in Yantai said their school had taken 500 renminbi out of their monthly wages. Their school declined an interview request. Some companies pay teachers directly to keep students in line in dormitories and on the factory floor, Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior has found. In other cases, companies pay management fees or set up extra facilities at schools. Foxconn says that while it pays teachers who supervise students, it usually does not compensate schools. ''However, in some cases, we do provide compensation to meet their overall administrative costs,'' it said.When a global committee of regulators and central bankers agreed to a new set of rules for the banking system a year and a half ago, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told The Financial Times, "I'm very close to thinking the United States shouldn't be in Basel anymore. I would not have agreed to rules that are blatantly anti-American." Over the last weekend, Mr. Dimon finally got what he had wanted: a form of deregulation of sorts. The new international capital requirements for banks, known as Basel III - apologies if your eyes are glazing over - were significantly relaxed by regulators. Instead of requiring banks to maintain, by 2015, a certain amount of assets that can quickly be turned into cash, the most stringent deadline was pushed to 2019. Perhaps more important, the type of assets that could be counted in a bank's liquidity requirement was changed to be more flexible, including securities backed by mortgages, for example, instead of simply sovereign debt. This sounds boring, but it is important stuff. Increasing bank capital and liquidity requirements - think of it as the size of a bank's rainy day fund - is arguably more significant than all of the new laws in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The more capital a bank is required to hold, the lower the chance it could suffer a run on the bank like Lehman Brothers did in 2008. Given memories of the financial crisis, the idea that regulators would loosen rules even a smidgen is considered a huge giveaway. The conventional wisdom is that the banks are the big winners and the regulators are, once again, patsies, capitulating under pressure to the all-powerful financial industry. The headlines tell the story: "Banks Win 4-Year Delay as Basel Liquidity Rule Loosened," Bloomberg declared. The Financial Times splashed, " 'Massive Softening' of Basel Rules." "Bank Regulators Retreat," the Huffington Post said. Reuters described the new regulations as a "light touch." Mayra Rodríguez Valladares, a managing principal at MRV Associates, a regulatory consulting firm, put it this way, "With every part of Basel III that is gutted, we are increasingly back where we were at the eve of the crisis." She went on to say, "In today's financial world, regulators pretend to supervise while banks pretend to be liquid." But this is a knee-jerk response. While there is no question that the original rules would do a better job preventing the next 100-year flood in the banking system, their quick adoption most likely would have created their own drag on the economy because bank lending would most likely have been curtailed. "If Basel had been implemented this year as written, it almost certainly would have thrown the U.S. and other economies into a recession more than going over the fiscal cliff ever would have," John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a research organization promoting free markets, wrote. Mr. Berlau, who may have a penchant for hyperbole, had been calling the deadline the Basel cliff. He added, "Basel III has been delayed, and for Main Street growth and financial stability, that is all to the good." Mr. Berlau is right. In truth, the reason that regulators ultimately chose to relax the rules was simple practicality: many banks in Europe and some in the United States would have never been able to meet the requirements without significantly reducing the amount of credit they were to extend to Main Street over the next two years, according to people involved in the Basel decision process. That's the other side of the regulatory coin that Main Street often forgets about. At the time that the original rules were written in 2010, the consensus among economists was that the global economy would be in much better shape today than it is. "Nobody set out to make it stronger or weaker, but to make it more realistic," Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, explained. Let's be clear: high capital requirements are a good thing to do to reduce risk in the system. And there is no question that the banks, especially in the United States, are in a much stronger position than they were. Let's also stipulate that the Basel committee did a horrible job before the financial crisis in setting and enforcing proper standards. Basel's loosening of rules before the crisis that worsened the pain of the global banking system. But the push for stricter rules just as the global economy is trying to nurse itself back to health, simply to satisfy the public, rather to find a solution that balances the risks to the economy and the banking system, would have been a mistake. The chances of a leverage-induced crisis from Wall Street banks right now is quite low. The challenge for regulators is making sure their memories aren't so short that they seek to scale back the rules again. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.MANAGEMENT CHANGES Citigroup announced a management reshuffle on Monday, appointing Jamie Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora co-presidents in the latest move to steer the sprawling bank toward greater profitability. Under the reorganization, Mr. Forese will take on Citi's institutional business and Mr. Medina-Mora will oversee the bank's consumer business and its operations in Mexico. The moves are the first management changes since an abrupt change at the top of the bank in October when the bank's board pushed out Vikram S. Pandit as chief executive and installed Michael L. Corbat, left. JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG NEW HOME Royal Bank of Canada announced on Monday that it had hired Mark Mahaney, 47, as a managing director covering Internet stocks, according to a news release from the bank. Citigroup dismissed Mr. Mahaney in October after regulators discovered that he had responded to a reporter's e-mail inquiry about the financial results of YouTube, a division of Google, without getting permission from the bank. PETER LATTMAN FILLING A GAP The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Monday that it had named Geoffrey F. Aronow general counsel, the agency's top legal post. The appointment fills an important gap in the S.E.C.'s roster. There have been a number of prominent departures in recent weeks, after the resignation of Mary L. Schapiro, left, as chairwoman in November. Mr. Aronow, a partner in the Washington office of Bingham McCutchen, was the head of enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the late 1990s. BEN PROTESS PUBLIC OFFERING A German property company owned by the Goldman Sachs investment fund Whitehall announced on Monday that it was planning an initial public offering of stock, one of the first new listings in Europe this year. The I.P.O. of LEG Immobilien, which specializes in residential property, is expected to raise up to 1 billion euros, or $1.3 billion. Shares in the company are expected to start trading in February, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. MARK SCOTT nytimes.com/dealbookAN advertising agency is rewriting a lyric of ''New York, New York'' to proclaim, ''If I can make it anywhere, I'll make it there.'' Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, a leading agency with headquarters in San Francisco, is opening an office in New York. The office, temporarily located at 7 World Trade Center, gives Goodby, Silverstein, which was founded in 1983, a New York presence for the first time. It is the agency's second office outside of San Francisco, after one in Detroit that opened in 2010 as Goodby, Silverstein, which is owned by the Omnicom Group, began creating campaigns for the Chevrolet division of General Motors. Two senior executives have relocated from San Francisco to lead the New York office, which will employ 15 to 25 people. They are Christian Haas, 39, who becomes partner and executive creative director, and Nancy Reyes, 37, who becomes associate partner and managing director. The agency is occupying the temporary space while its permanent location, 200 Varick Street at Houston Street, is being remodeled. Plans call for an opening in April. The office opens with work from current clients like Comcast, Elizabeth Arden, Google and YouTube. Goodby, Silverstein's other clients include Adobe, the California Milk Processor Board, Cisco, Frito-Lay, the National Basketball Association, Nestlé and Sonic. Ms. Reyes and Mr. Haas say they are eager to look for new business in New York with the help of the agency's co-chairmen and creative directors, Jeff Goodby and Rich Silverstein. In the ''Mad Men'' era, only a handful of American ad agencies with heavyweight creative credentials were located outside New York, a city so widely regarded as the heart of advertising that the phrase ''Madison Avenue'' became shorthand for the industry. That changed in the 1970s as the business began to decentralize, partly because the dire financial and quality-of-life problems in New York led many talented executives to pursue careers elsewhere. Agencies like Goodby, Silverstein became known almost as much for not being in New York -- opting instead for cities like Austin, Tex.; Boston; Los Angeles; Miami; Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Richmond, Va.; and San Francisco -- as for the ads they created. Some of those agencies eventually added New York outposts. Some opened in New York but later retreated, and some still eschew New York. But declining to take a bite out of the Big Apple is becoming less appealing, primarily because New York has overcome the perception issues that once cost it so dearly. ''We just lose so many people to New York,'' Mr. Goodby said in a phone interview last week from San Francisco. ''It's crazy not to access that.'' The executives who founded agencies outside New York did so to ''kindle a 'creative shop' feeling,'' Mr. Goodby said: a feeling they did not believe they could cultivate in a city dominated by giant, tradition-minded agencies. ''I don't think Rich and I felt we needed a New York office,'' he said. ''In fact, it was more unique to not have one.'' In his presentations to prospective East Coast clients, Mr. Goodby normally includes a slide that addresses why the agency has its headquarters on the West Coast. It reads: ''You call it distance. We call it perspective.'' ''I think I'm going to ask to have that slide retired,'' he said, laughing. Goodby, Silverstein was started as Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein by three colleagues at Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco. The third founder, Andy Berlin, left for New York in 1992, three months after Omnicom acquired the 62.5 percent of the agency that it had not already owned, and he has spent the rest of his career there. There was talk then that Omnicom would transform the agency into its third worldwide network, joining DDB and BBDO, in an expansion that would start with the opening of an office in New York. But a year later, Omnicom bought TBWA International, now TBWA Worldwide, and made that its third network instead. ''San Francisco is so livable, but there's nothing like New York,'' Mr. Silverstein said in an interview last week in Midtown Manhattan, at which he was joined by Mr. Haas and Ms. Reyes. ''It's a cliché, but it's true. Go East, young man, go East.'' The executives acknowledge the risks of the move. They do not want other agencies to conclude that Goodby, Silverstein is trying to ride in like the cavalry to rescue Madison Avenue. ''There's nothing wrong with what's going on in New York,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''New York doesn't 'need' another ad agency.'' Likewise, Ms. Reyes said, ''there's nothing wrong with what's going on at Goodby, Silverstein in San Francisco.'' What became clear was that Goodby, Silverstein was losing prospective employees to New York. It was ''less about them saying, 'I've got to go to that agency in New York,' than, 'I want to be in New York,' '' Mr. Silverstein said. In fact, he said, a major reason he and Mr. Goodby finally decided to open an office in New York was that Ms. Reyes and Mr. Haas had confided that they wanted to move there. Mr. Haas has worked in São Paulo, Brazil, in addition to San Francisco, but he has never worked in New York. ''São Paulo is, in a weird way, kind of like New York,'' he said, but ''the energy, the buzz'' of New York are difficult to duplicate. Ms. Reyes worked at New York agencies like D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Ogilvy & Mather before leaving in 2003 to join Goodby, Silverstein. In the last decade, ''we lost lots of people in San Francisco to New York,'' she said. ''We'll call on them.''Accounts ¶Barkley, Kansas City, Mo., won two creative assignments with combined annual spending estimated at more than $130 million. Barkley was selected as the creative agency of record for International Dairy Queen, Minneapolis, part of Berkshire Hathaway, succeeding Grey New York, part of the Grey division of the Grey Group, which is owned by WPP.

The ads, for Adams Flea and Tick Spot On for Dogs, sold by Farnam, included claims that the product ''starts to kill fleas and ticks in 15 minutes''; the division said the evidence provided by Farnam showed the product reached full efficacy seven days after application. The agencies are the Federal Trade Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency; the E.P.A. is involved because the active ingredients in the product are pesticides that are regulated by the E.P.A. The division, part of the advertising industry's self-regulatory process, became involved because the FidoPharm division of Velcera, which makes PetArmor, a product that competes against the Farnam product, brought to the division a challenge to the claims.For a column that laid out some second thoughts on Big Data, one of the people I talked to was Thomas H. Davenport, who has worked in the fields of knowledge management and analytics for 15 years. Data analytics is the predecessor to Big Data. He knows the context -- what's new and what's not with Big Data -- as well as anyone. Mr. Davenport, a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School (on leave from Babson College), has authored and co-authored several books on analytics, including "Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning" (with Jeanne G. Harris, Harvard Business School Press, 2007). Shortly after the Big Data phenomenon took off, Mr. Davenport said, only half-joking, that he considered simply substituting the term "Big Data" for "analytics" for updated versions of his books. But as he looked more deeply, there really was something different in Big Data. Data volumes have been steadily increasing for decades, Mr. Davenport noted, though the pace has accelerated sharply in the Internet age. "More than the amount of data itself, the unstructured data from the Web and sensors is a much more salient feature of what is being called Big Data," he said. I also asked David B. Yoffie, a technology and competitive strategy expert at Harvard, who is not part of the Big Data crowd, what he thought. The Internet, he observed, has been a mainstream technology for 15 years, and so has the ability to monitor and mine Web browsing behavior and online communications, even if those skills are much improved now. Still, Mr. Yoffie is most impressed by the rapid spread of low-cost sensors that make it possible to monitor all kinds of physical objects, from fruit shipments (sniffing for signs of spoilage) to jet engines (tracking wear to predict when maintenance is needed). "The ubiquity of sensors is new," Mr. Yoffie said. "The sensors make it possible to get data we never had before." Machine-generated sensor data will be become a far larger portion of the Big Data world, according to a recent report by IDC. The research report, "The Digital Universe in 2020," published in December, traces data trends from 2005-20. One of its forecasts is that machine-generated data will increase to 42 percent of all data by 2020, up from 11 percent in 2005. "It's all those sensors, the Internet of Things data," said Jeremy Burton, an executive vice president at EMC, which sponsored the IDC report. The implication is that Big Data technology will steadily move beyond the consumer Internet. Industrial companies like General Electric are already making big bets on the payoff. The IDC forecast also suggests that there is a lot of substance to the vision of machine-to-machine communication and intelligence that W. Brian Arthur terms "the second economy." This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.The Treasury's schedule of financing this week includes Monday's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills and an auction of four-week bills on Tuesday.

Raymond James & AssociatesLOS ANGELES - To Philip Horn, the Braemar Country Club was not just a golf course, it was an extension of his office. Most weeks, Mr. Horn, a financial adviser at Wells Fargo, chatted up potential clients between holes at the upscale club set against the backdrop of the Santa Monica Mountains. "I always thought, 'This is a great guy and a straight shooter,' " said Barry Zelner, one of several country club members who invested with Mr. Horn. Now, those same clients are wondering what went wrong. After Wells Fargo alerted him to account discrepancies, Mr. Zelner, a corporate lawyer, said he stormed onto the club's rolling greens in April, accusing the broker of theft. "Tell them what you did, Phil," the lawyer bellowed among a crowd of members. A few months later, Mr. Horn pleaded guilty to defrauding more than a dozen clients and Wells Fargo. While Mr. Horn is a relatively minor player in the pantheon of financial fraud, his actions highlight the persistent problems with policing the industry, even after the wave of rules enacted since the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's giant Ponzi scheme in 2008. And the challenge of oversight is not becoming any easier, with the ranks of financial advisers swelling. As new regulations crimp profits, big banks like Wells Fargo are ramping up their brokerage businesses in an effort to make up for lost revenue. Amid the renewed focus, banks have spent millions of dollars to beef up their compliance systems and improve their oversight. Regulators, too, have bolstered their efforts, increasing enforcement and adopting new measures. Every month, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a Wall Street watchdog, penalizes more than 100 brokers for various actions, including unauthorized trading and fraudulent activities, as well as smaller violations. "Theft, Ponzi schemes and other financial scams continue to happen at an alarming rate," said Thomas Ajamie, a plaintiff's lawyer who represents two of Mr. Horn's clients. For more than two years, Mr. Horn systematically executed and canceled trades in clients' portfolios, pocketing the profits. To avoid detection, he limited his paper trail and made it appear that the trades originated in his own account, according to court documents. "It's simply unbelievable to me that this kind of fraud could happen for so long without Wells Fargo doing anything about it," Mr. Zelner said. After meeting Mr. Horn on the golf course, Derek Brown invested more than $10 million with him in 2006, assured by the Wells Fargo name on his business card. "This wasn't just Schlepper & Schlepper," Mr. Brown, a retired pharmaceutical executive, said. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Raschelle Burton, said the bank discovered the problems with Mr. Horn in October 2011 and immediately alerted law enforcement agencies. Wells Fargo also fired Mr. Horn. Mr. Horn is set to be sentenced on Monday. Prosecutors have recommended an 18-month sentence. A lawyer for Mr. Horn declined to comment. Some of Mr. Horn's clients are struggling to understand the extent of their losses. Mr. Brown and Mr. Zelner say that Wells Fargo has not let them review the trading records. Instead, they have had to rely on the bank's analysis. "The firm believes it has provided appropriate information," Ms. Burton said. Prosecutors estimate the scheme's damages at $732,000. But there are indications the losses could be higher. Last year, Wells Fargo, without explanation, transferred roughly $500,000 to an account that Mr. Brown has at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Brown said he planned to file a lawsuit seeking additional compensation. While some clients still have concerns, Wells Fargo said the matter had been resolved and declined to provide further details. "In cases where his actions harmed the clients, the firm has either credited those accounts or reached another resolution with those clients," Ms. Burton said. On paper, Mr. Horn seemed like a model broker. After a short stint at Lehman Brothers in New York, he spent a decade at Citigroup in Los Angeles, moving to Wells Fargo in 2006. For much of his career, his regulatory record was clean, with few customer complaints. At Wells Fargo, Mr. Horn, who worked in a team of brokers, seemed to land clients without an aggressive approach. He wooed clients slowly, often over many years. Between golf holes, he would casually mention winning trades, almost as an aside. He nurtured friendships with clients. Norman Strang, an 80-year-old retired aerospace executive, said his wife regularly cooked dinner for Mr. Horn at the couple's home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. "Here he was being this friendly guy, and yet he stole several thousands of dollars from our account." Mr. Horn went to the weddings of both Mr. Brown's children and planned to join him on a charitable trip to Israel and Morocco in the fall of 2011. In 2011, Mr. Horn invited clients to his 50th birthday party inspired by the movie "Saturday Night Fever." The tall and lanky Mr. Horn wore a white disco suit and handed out CDs with a cover that superimposed his head onto John Travolta's body. Given Mr. Horn's gregarious nature, clients say they dismissed what should have been red flags. According to Mr. Zelner, Mr. Horn avoided meeting at his office, preferring the golf course. Between games, they would meet in the country club's parking lot, where the broker would pull trading documents from his trunk. "Phil would present his investments as if he was giving you something that would protect you," said Mr. Zelner, adding that "he was also just a guy you wanted to drink with." Many clients trusted him. Each month, they received thick booklets detailing trading activity, but few pored over the trades. "If I had time to do that, I wouldn't need a broker," Mr. Brown said. Amid hundreds of legitimate transactions, a dubious trade was also hard to spot. In one instance, Mr. Horn bought 1,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund for $77.93 apiece on Feb. 15, 2011, according to Mr. Brown's bank statements. A month later, Mr. Horn canceled the trade. By then, the price had surged to $86. But the transaction was buried within more than 50 double-sided pages. It appeared as a canceled trade, which by itself was not alarming. Mr. Brown and his wife did not know anything was amiss until they received a startling call from an executive at Wells Fargo. While the couple were celebrating the Jewish holidays in Toronto in October 2011, the bank executive told them about the problems with their account. Mr. Brown added, "He said we had a 'six-figure problem.' " This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.LAS VEGAS -- Your smartphone is the screen in your pocket. Your computer is the screen on your desk. Your tablet is a screen for the couch. Almost every major electronic device you own is a black rectangle that is brought to life by software and content. So how can hardware companies make their products stand out in a sea of black rectangles? That challenge will be on display at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Tuesday through Friday at the 46th annual Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest technology conventions based on attendance, which is expected to exceed 150,000 this year. And one that is particularly acute for television makers. ''The hardware is no longer what's driving the future,'' said James L. McQuivey, an analyst for Forrester Research. ''The hardware is kind of boring.'' More exciting things are happening in software, Mr. McQuivey said. For example, dozens of tablets are on the market, but Apple and Amazon lead the pack because of the impressive apps and digital content available for their devices, he said. This year, television makers like Samsung, Sony, LG and Panasonic are trying to grab attention by supersizing their television screens and quadrupling the level of detail in their images. And manufacturers continue to push the idea of ''smart'' sets by adding apps and other interactive elements. For the electronics industry, the television is an important but increasingly difficult product to sell. Just seven years ago, big-screen sets that cost thousands of dollars were major profit generators. But more recently, even as televisions have gotten bigger and better looking, they have dropped significantly in price amid heated competition. To make matters worse, consumers are buying new televisions as often as they buy a new car, not as often as a new computer or phone. And people can now watch video on smartphones, tablets and computers, reducing the need to buy a television at all. Sales of televisions over the holiday season were down 2 percent from the previous year, according to Stephen Baker, an analyst for the NPD Group. Mr. Baker said one problem for television makers was that bigger screens, ranging from 50 inches to 55 inches were taking sales from televisions in the 40- to 49-inch range, once an especially popular category. The average selling price of a 45- or 49-inch set was $615, but sets in the range of 50 to 54 inches actually had a lower average price, $520, Mr. Baker said. This is because people who bought the smaller televisions opted for features like LED screen technology and Internet capability, but more budget-conscious consumers chose size over other features. As they try to prop up profits, electronics makers are trying hard to establish a new high-end category of televisions. They are promoting what they call Ultra High-Definition televisions, which have four times as many pixels as their high-definition predecessors. Some of these new televisions can cost as much as a car, like Sony's 84-inch Ultra HDTV, which is priced at $25,000. But Sony says it will unveil Ultra HDTVs at the show that are smaller and less expensive. Mike Lucas, a senior vice president at Sony, called its 84-inch set the Ferrari of televisions. But he said that with the new versions, ''we're moving out from the Ferrari world and more into the Audi, Lexus and Mercedes side of the world.'' He declined to say how much the smaller Ultra HD sets would cost, but said they would be more expensive than the older HDTVs. Samsung will also introduce new televisions this week, including an Ultra HDTV that emphasizes software. Joe Stinziano, senior vice president for home entertainment at Samsung Electronics America, said a majority of the new Samsung sets this year would be smart televisions -- Internet-enabled televisions that run apps for things like Netflix and Facebook. ''The television has always been the center of the entertainment of the home,'' Mr. Stinziano said. ''Now it will be the center of a connected home.'' Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, a consulting firm that studies displays, said he was not enthusiastic about the new higher resolution sets. Mr. Soneira said Ultra HD would make a difference only on screens that were at least 80 inches, measured diagonally. For smaller screens, the extra pixels would not be visible to a person with 20/20 vision viewing from a normal distance of at least 7.2 feet, he said. ''It's a bit of a marketing push,'' Mr. Soneira said. ''It's really pointless for a small TV under typical viewing conditions.'' Mr. McQuivey of Forrester agreed, adding that very little content is available that takes advantage of the Ultra HD format. In the last two years, television makers have tried a similar push with 3-D sets, but consumers decided that the ability to watch a handful of movies in 3-D did not justify spending thousands of dollars on a new television. He predicted that Ultra HD TVs would also be a flop. Industry officials cited reasons for more optimism. Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the electronics show, said he once predicted that high-definition television would fail because of the lack of HD content available at the time. But it turned out that early adopters were buying the sets because they made DVDs look better. ''With Ultra HD, you're going to see people stepping up, too, and you'll see at the show it's going to be a big deal,'' Mr. Shapiro said. Mr. Lucas of Sony said its Ultra HD TVs would use software to pump up the number of pixels in videos to make them look as if they were shot at a higher resolution. But Mr. Soneira said that this approach, called ''upconverting,'' cannot add details that were not in the original image, and would not make a difference on screens smaller than 80 inches. Apple, the technology industry's most profitable hardware maker, does not attend trade shows, including the Consumer Electronics Show, because it can easily reach customers through its retail stores. But it is always on competitors' minds. Rumors have been swirling for years that Apple would make its own television, and many analysts expect it to introduce one this year. Mr. McQuivey of Forrester has been writing for some time about what Apple should do with a television. He said Apple should ignore the Ultra HD game and make the first ''non-TV TV.'' He imagined a 32-inch screen that can be controlled with touch and voice commands, hung on the wall of a room where a family would get together to talk or eat. Apple could push software developers to make apps that serve as the hub of family life, to supplement the built-in shared calendars, photos and video chats with Grandma, he said. ''Apple needs to create a new experience for the television, not a new dimension of hardware,'' Mr. McQuivey said. ''That's part of what has to change in the long run.''LONDON -- At first glance the willingness of Al Jazeera, the satellite network owned and financed by Qatar, to pay in the neighborhood of $500 million for Current TV, Al Gore's struggling channel, seems like a vanity project. And it may turn out that way. But in recent years Qatar has developed what is one of the more energetic and sophisticated foreign investment strategies of the Gulf oil and gas producers. Al Jazeera's expansion plan in the United States can be seen as part of its overall plan to put itself on the map and make itself heard globally. The Qatari leadership want to propagate ''a Qatari-sponsored narrative of events in the Middle East and elsewhere,'' said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Gulf analyst at Chatham House, a London research institute. ''Being able to shape that narrative and how it is being seen in the U.S. is extremely important.'' When he overthrew his father in 1995, Qatar's ruler, Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, took control of what was a small and vulnerable country jutting out into the Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. He has assiduously worked to change Qatar's circumstances, most notably by bringing in partners like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell to build the liquefied natural gas installations needed to exploit Qatar's enormous North Field. As a result, Qatar, which had been a relatively small oil producer, is now the world's dominant L.N.G. power with financial surpluses in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion a year, according to Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London. The oil and gas money has given the ruler and his key collaborator, Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim al Thani, the means to transform the once sleepy capital, Doha, into a Dubai-like cityscape that has become a preferred location for international conferences like the recent COP 18 summit meeting and prestigious sports events like the 2022 World Cup in soccer. Qatar is also now the world's wealthiest country per capita. Income was close to $100,000 per person in 2011, according to the C.I.A. World Factbook. Having so much money to spend has helped make the Qataris key global deal makers in both business and politics. ''The leadership of Qatar is probably the most dynamic and ambitious of any senior leadership in the Gulf,'' Tarik Yousef, chief executive of Silatech, a Qatari nonprofit that helps young people in the Middle East set up businesses, said in an interview last year. ''They not only have ambitions and drive, but they have phenomenal financial resources.'' That ambition and drive have been conspicuously in evidence of late. In a high-profile gambit involving mediation by Tony Blair, Britain's former prime minister, Qatar helped force Glencore to increase its takeover bid last autumn for the miner Xstrata, in which Qatar's sovereign wealth fund held a large stake, increasing the price of the multibillion-dollar deal 9 percent, said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie in London. Despite being a tightly controlled monarchy, Qatar is the only Gulf country that has enthusiastically bought into the Arab Spring revolutionary movements that have roiled the Middle East over the past two years. Qatari aid was instrumental in toppling the Libyan dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and its leadership was early in calling for the departure of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Qatar has backed the government of President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt with promises of billions in investment, including money for an oil refinery near Cairo. Some of these decisions, like investing in the Xstrata deal or Qatar's supplying new capital to Britain's Barclays bank during the financial crisis -- a matter that is now under investigation in Britain -- make good business sense. So does Qatar's stake-building in major Western companies including Shell, the German construction giant Hochtief and Volkswagen. But they also help accentuate Qatar's political clout. When buying large shareholdings ''you are gaining access to a network. It's almost a means of doing politics,'' said a senior Western investment banker in the Gulf last year, who declined to be identified because it might affect his business. Being the site of billions of dollars in investment by major oil companies including ExxonMobil, Shell and Total also enhances Qatar's relevance, as do its L.N.G. contracts with countries like Japan and China. The Qataris are thinking ''if you have many long-term partners around the world, you won't be sacrificed in a time of need,'' said Mr. Ulrichsen of Chatham House. In this context, Al Jazeera's plan to expand in the United States may be seen as another part of Qatar's global outreach campaign, though Al Jazeera has changed its tactics from its early days. Al Jazeera's English channel, introduced in 2006, has helped at least partially change its image from that of a network used as a vehicle by Al Qaeda and hostile to the United States to that of a professionally run news channel that has won prominent U.S. journalism prizes, including George Foster Peabody and George Polk awards last year. The Polk prize came for coverage of unrest in Bahrain, another small Gulf emirate. ''The key question is whether this is to give Al Jazeera in English more exposure in its current relatively objective form or to buy a forum for sending more of a Qatari and Arab message to U.S. viewers,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a Gulf security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The English channel has struggled to find viewers in the United States. It reaches only 4.7 million homes and far fewer actual viewers. The deal for Current TV will multiply potential viewers almost tenfold. ''This is intended to be a commercial venture,'' said Stan Collender, a spokesman for the company. Al Jazeera made the purchase only after ''several years of study,'' he said.TAIPEI -- In the China smartphone market, Apple has seen better days. Despite having reported record sales of the iPhone 5, the U.S. technology giant's presence on the mainland flagged in 2012; it was pushed out of the top five smartphone makers in that market during the third quarter, with just 8 percent of the market, according to the research firm Canalys. As Coolpad, Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE surged ahead of Apple, a major force behind their success was MediaTek, a Taiwanese chip maker whose products have drastically reduced the cost for manufacturers of getting new phones to market. The company entered the smartphone business late, introducing its first chipset in 2011 inside a Lenovo phone. But within a year and a half, analysts say, MediaTek has taken 50 percent of China's market for smartphone chips. That success has come with the adoption of what MediaTek calls a ''turnkey solution.'' Rather than simply provide a chip, the company also offers instructions on how to build a phone, the software architecture to run it and dedicated consultants to advise phone makers through the production process. MediaTek's chief financial officer, David Ku, describes this as a franchise model in which all the clients have to do is ''turn on the burner.'' Peter Liao, an analyst at Nomura Securities who covers the industry, said MediaTek saved phone makers the often prohibitive cost of research and development. ''It typically takes a lot of money and time to develop a new handset model, but MediaTek comes in and provides a total solution,'' Mr. Liao said. The company has proved wildly popular among Chinese phone makers. Besides supplying Huawei, Lenovo and ZTE, MediaTek also supports lesser-known manufacturers, including those that make so-called bandit phones that imitate premium models from Apple, Samsung and HTC. TCL Communication Technology Holdings, a Chinese phone maker that sells phones primarily in Europe and Latin America, uses MediaTek's chips. Its chief operating officer, Wang Jiyang, said that when his company works with MediaTek, its only major design tasks are to make the software more user-friendly and to tailor the look and feel of the phone. ''In general, with MediaTek's help, we're able to achieve almost twice as fast time to market, compared to other solutions,'' Mr. Wang said. MediaTek was founded in 1997. It started out making chips for home entertainment electronics like DVD players and televisions before moving into components for CD and DVD-ROM devices. In 2004, it began making chips for small mobile phones. MediaTek estimates that it will lead the Chinese market by selling 110 million smartphone chips in 2012, up from 10 million chips a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm, the global leader in smartphone chips, is expected to finish 2012 in second place in China with 82 million chips shipped, according to the research firm DigiTimes. MediaTek has been powered by consumers like Zhang Ying, 31, who want to try the latest technology but not pay a premium for it. Mr. Zhang, a Shanghai resident, bought a knockoff HTC phone last year. ''Every person has a price point,'' he said. ''At a time when some of my friends were buying Samsung or iPhone, I wanted to show that I can keep up with them. A lot of domestic phones are cheap and of fairly good quality.'' People who think like Mr. Zhang are dominating sales, especially among first-time smartphone buyers. In a September report, McKinsey, the global consulting firm, estimated that 69 percent of all smartphones sold in China would cost less than 1,500 renminbi, or about $240, by the second half of 2013. And MediaTek is taking its business model to other emerging markets. The company's products support features that are popular in developing countries, like noise-reducing speakers and slots for two SIM cards. In India, local brands like Spice and Micromax are rolling out lower-priced smartphone models using MediaTek parts. In Brazil, phones by Motorola Mobility, as well as local brands like Gradiente and Multilaser, will also have MediaTek chips. ''The markets we target have 5.8 billion people, whereas the U.S. and Europe have less than one billion,'' said Mr. Ku of MediaTek. ''I need to aim at a global market, not just developed countries.'' MediaTek also released a chip last year for building basic smartphones that work in regions without mobile data networks. Users of these phones rely on Wi-Fi connections to download multimedia. These phones can cost as little as $50, or 312 renminbi. Those chips now account for 40 percent of MediaTek's smartphone chip sales, according to the company. Mark Hung, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, calls the network-less chip one of the ''fastest-growing smartphone segments,'' as many consumers are looking to switch from their simple mobile phones to basic, low-cost smartphones. ''This is a fairly new phenomenon, and as you can expect, mostly in emerging markets, including China,'' Mr. Hung said. For now, Apple has signaled that it has no intention of competing on price. The iPhone 5, released in China on Dec. 14, cost 300 renminbi more than the two previous models, the iPhone 4S and 4, on their release days. More than two million units of the iPhone 5 were sold during its first weekend. By contrast, Coolpad, Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE have rolled out new phones with similar performance at a third of the iPhone 5's price of 5,288 renminbi, and sometimes less. ''We believe that emerging countries should also be able to enjoy the use of information technology with the same computing power,'' said Tsai Ming-kai, chief executive of MediaTek. As the world's largest market for smartphones, China is quickly becoming a bellwether for the progress of sales wars globally. The Chinese experience may show that any leading market position can be fickle, and new brands can appear seemingly out of nowhere to capture significant market shares. Apple remains No. 2 in smartphone shipments worldwide after Samsung, but its position could be threatened as the competition expands to more consumers and more price points. ''Emerging economies are getting stronger,'' Mr. Tsai said. ''The industry dynamic is always evolving. Anything can happen.''Tingye Li, an electrical engineer whose calculations in the early 1960s helped guide the development of the laser and propel the dizzying increase in the speed of fiber-optic communication, died on Dec. 27 in Snowbird, Utah. He was 81. The cause was a heart attack while he was on a family ski trip, his family said. He lived in Boulder, Colo. Lasers were in the early stage of development when Dr. Li and a colleague at Bell Labs, A. Gardner Fox, developed a computer simulation of how lasers produce the focused light energy that has transformed fields from medicine to space travel. They reported their findings in a paper published in 1961. Dr. Arno Penzias, a former director of Bell, called their paper a tool kit for subsequent designers of lasers and other optical systems. He said it helped transform the ''wonderful invention'' of the laser -- the word is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation -- into ''a practical communications platform.'' In essence, the researchers provided a mathematical model for how light bounces about inside a laser between two mirrors as it gathers energy, predicting factors like the shape and intensity of light beams. Alan Willner, an electrical engineering professor at the University of Southern California, called the work ''the foundational teaching'' on the innards of lasers. ''There aren't many papers that help define a field, but this was one of them,'' he said in an interview. The research that led to nearly instantaneous communication by light waves was itself snail-like. Dr. Li and Dr. Fox had to write their own programs, punching them into decks of cards, for a room-size computer that was less powerful than a palm-size calculator today. The computer ran the program for two or three hours. A frequent error message meant that the researchers had to scour the cards for a single improperly punched letter, Jeff Hecht wrote in ''Beam: The Race to Make the Laser'' (2010). Bell Labs was virtually unchallenged as the largest and most inventive laboratory in the world, having a hand in many of the 20th century's most important inventions. Dr. Li, who wrote or helped write more than 100 papers, patents and books, led research teams at Bell for more than three decades. Some of their work laid the groundwork for today's broadband. One area of study was in finding ways to use light waves to convey information on optical fiber rather than copper wire or radio waves. Another team Dr. Li led developed optical amplifiers, which amplify an optical signal directly without the need to first convert it into an electrical signal. Dr. Li was an early proponent of using the rare earth metal Erbium in the amplifiers, an improvement that helped raise their capacity more than a hundredfold. ''Tingye Li has shaped the lightwave network infrastructure we know today,'' the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers said when presenting him with its Edison Medal in 2009. Li Ding Yi, as his name is transliterated from Chinese, was born in Nanking, China, on July 7, 1931. His mother, Lily, belonged to the first generation of Chinese women to receive a modern higher education. She became an activist for women's rights. His father, Chao, was a Chinese diplomat who was consul general in Vancouver, where Tingye attended middle school, and was later posted to South Africa, where Tingye earned an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Witwatersrand. He earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Dr. Li joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories (later AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1957 and worked there until 1998. He worked there with the Nobel Prize recipients Charles Hard Townes and Arthur L. Schawlow, who together invented the maser, which amplified microwaves the way lasers would soon amplify light. ''There was a lot going on and a lot of people helping each other,'' Dr. Penzias said. Dr. Li often quoted Confucius, though friends suspected he occasionally concocted his own learned sayings and then attributed them to the sage. He frequently went to China to help it develop optical communications. The Chinese Academy sent his family a letter at his death praising him for helping China ''leapfrog to a higher level'' in handling telecommunications traffic. Dr. Li is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Edith Wu; his daughters, Deborah Li Cohen and Kathryn Li Dessau; and four grandchildren. In a speech on his 80th birthday, Dr. Li revealed that he had proposed marriage to his wife for their next life, after they are both reincarnated. She tentatively agreed, he said, if he behaved.A $10 billion settlement to resolve claims of foreclosure abuses by 14 major lenders is expected to be announced as early as Monday, several people with knowledge of the discussions said on Sunday. The settlement comes after weeks of negotiations between federal regulators and the banks, and covers abuses like flawed paperwork and botched loan modifications, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been made public. An estimated $3.75 billion of the $10 billion is to be distributed in cash relief to Americans who went through foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, these people said. An additional $6 billion is to be directed toward homeowners in danger of losing their homes after falling behind on their monthly payments. All 14 banks , including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, are expected to sign on. The agreement comes almost a year after a sweeping deal in February between state attorneys general and five large mortgage lenders. The settlement almost fell apart over the weekend. Some officials at the Federal Reserve threatened to scuttle the deal unless the banks agreed to pay an additional $300 million for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, which upended the housing market and led to millions of foreclosures. The Fed officials argued for additional aid for homeowners ensnared in a flawed foreclosure process, according to several people briefed on the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity. The $300 million demand was to come on top of the $10 billion payout, but was met with resistance from the banks, especially because it was raised late in the day on Friday, according to these people. The Federal Reserve officials backed down, allowing the $10 billion pact to move forward ahead of bank earnings releases this month, these people said. During the last week, officials from the Federal Reserve met with community groups and consumer advocates to gather comments about a settlement. It was those talks that induced the Fed to forgo the request for additional money, according to three people familiar with the matter. The thinking, these people said, was that broad relief was better than a lengthy review process that had not yielded much relief. Representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which led banking regulators in the negotiations, declined to provide further details on the settlement. Still, some housing advocates said the settlement did not go far enough in providing relief. Bruce Marks, chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, expressed cautious optimism about the deal, but added that the ''devil is in the details.'' It is still unclear how the monetary relief will be distributed among homeowners, but one immediate result of the settlement is the end of a troubled review of millions of loan files. As part of a consent order in April 2011, the comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve established the Independent Foreclosure Review, which mandated that banks hire independent consultants to audit loan files and look for illegal fees, bungled loan modifications and instances where borrowers lost their homes even though they were current on their payments. Only 323,000 homeowners submitted claims for their files to be reviewed. Within the comptroller's office, senior officials raised concerns that the reviews had grown bloated and inefficient, especially after each loan took more than 20 hours to review, up from original estimates of eight hours a file. The mounting costs of the reviews, up to $250 an hour, began to worry the banking regulators, according to several of the people with knowledge of the matter. So far, the foreclosure review program has cost the banks an estimated $1.5 billion, according to these people. Banking regulators grew concerned that the reviews were not producing meaningful instances of banks wrongfully seizing the homes of borrowers who were current on their payments, according to these people. Told last week of the plans to stop the foreclosure reviews, some consumer advocates expressed concern that the full extent of the damage to homeowners would never be known. Some of the advocates have questioned whether the banks were getting off too easily because they selected and paid the consultants charged with examining their loans.It began more than 90 years ago as a small tax break intended to help family farmers who wanted to swap horses and land. Farmers who sold property, livestock or equipment were allowed to avoid paying capital gains taxes, as long as they used the proceeds to replace or upgrade their assets. Over the years, however, as the rules were loosened, the practice of exchanging one asset for another without incurring taxes spread to everyone from commercial real estate developers and art collectors to major corporations. It provides subsidies for rental truck fleets and investment property, vacation homes, oil wells and thoroughbred racehorses, and diverts billions of dollars in potential tax revenue from the Treasury each year. Yet even with those generous terms, some major American companies -- including Cendant, Wells Fargo and General Electric -- have routinely pushed the boundaries while claiming lucrative tax savings, according to evidence recently presented at a federal trial in New York. President Obama and Congressional leaders agreed New Year's Day to a limited agreement to raise taxes on the wealthy, and the president said over the weekend that he would press this year for broader reform in the tax code. The expansion of the tax break once intended to help farmers illustrates the challenges ahead and how special interests have learned to use the tax code to maximum effect. The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives -- which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates -- either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers. Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code's preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses. ''Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they're easy to start,'' said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. ''But once a tax break gets started, people think they're entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.'' Many tax breaks began with narrow targets and expanded into vast, expensive subsidies far beyond their original intent or the Internal Revenue Service's ability to monitor them. Most have developed constituencies of taxpayers, lobbyists and elected officials who fiercely defend them, making it politically treacherous to limit or eliminate them. With hundreds of thousands of transactions a year, it is hard to gauge the true cost of the tax break for so-called like-kind exchanges, like those used by Cendant, General Electric and Wells Fargo. The government estimates that it diverts less than $3 billion a year from the Treasury, but industry statistics suggest the number could be far higher. The tax break also exposes one of the greatest vulnerabilities of the United States tax system: it depends on voluntary compliance. The I.R.S. staff is so outnumbered by tax lawyers and accounting departments at major corporations that there is often little to prevent taxpayers from taking a freewheeling approach to interpreting and administering the rules. What's more, the tax break is one of so many that it tends to escape attention. The independent Simpson-Bowles deficit commission appointed by Mr. Obama in 2010 raised the possibility of eliminating it and other tax expenditures, however, and some budget experts argue that the program should be severely limited or repealed. Some financial planners and economists say that the tax break even favors real estate investors unfairly by allowing them to defer capital gains taxes that those who invest in securities and other ventures have to pay. And although it was originally intended to help farmers, some economists and lawmakers in agricultural areas say it has perversely contributed to suburban sprawl and the spiraling cost of farmland. Because it allows farmers to avoid capital gains taxes on land swaps, the tax break provides an incentive to sell farmland coveted by developers and buy property in less desirable and more remote areas. A crucial element of the tax break is that companies cannot use the proceeds of an asset sale for any purpose other than buying a replacement. Because the break is intended to encourage reinvestment in a business, companies that sell an asset are required to deposit the proceeds from the sale into an escrow account, which must be controlled by a third party. If the company has control of the money, the tax break is disallowed, according to tax experts. ''Funds cannot be held under the taxpayer's sole control,'' said David Shechtman, a lawyer who headed the American Bar Association tax committee that oversees the exchanges. Documents and testimony at the recent federal trial indicate that a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest banks, JPMorgan Chase, stood by for years as the companies -- most of which were also major depositors in the bank -- bent the rules governing these exchanges of property. JPMorgan sold the subsidiary in 2008. At least a half-dozen companies were allowed unrestricted access, according to evidence at the trial. For at least 30 months, Wells Fargo had unfettered access to billions of dollars intended to be held in escrow, the records show. And American subsidiaries of Volkswagen and BMW had so much control over the money that they used it as collateral to obtain lines of credit. Oscar Suris, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. Officials at Volkswagen and BMW said they were confident that the companies were in full compliance with tax regulations. A spokesman for Cendant, John Barrows, said that company, which is now the Avis Budget Group, had complied with all tax laws and I.R.S. regulations. JPMorgan's lawyers argued during the trial that the instances in which its clients were apparently allowed to skirt the tax rules had been few, inadvertent and, in some cases, approved by tax lawyers and accountants who worked for the companies. Officials at JPEX, the subsidiary that handled the transactions, testified that because they were not tax experts, they deferred to their clients' accountants and legal specialists. JPMorgan said its employees never violated tax regulations. ''The court agreed that our firm acted appropriately and that this business complied with all relevant tax laws at the time our firm owned it,'' said Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman. The largest corporation cited in the case, General Electric, had unrestricted access to nearly $300 million from transactions made by its equipment finance subsidiary from 2007 to 2009, according to testimony, documents and company officials. The money -- which saved G.E. $3 million to $4 million a year in interest because of tax deferrals, according to company estimates -- was kept in G.E.'s internal computer system, WebCash, which is controlled solely by company employees rather than by an intermediary. Russell Wilkerson, a managing director at G.E. Capital, said outside tax advisers had assured the company that its unorthodox arrangement met I.R.S. regulations because it required the approval of the intermediary before any transaction was made. ''G.E. has always executed its like-kind exchange programs in a fully compliant manner, without exception,'' Mr. Wilkerson said. Evidence about the questionable procedures was made public as part of a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court by NES Financial, a California company that acquired JPEX in 2008. NES Financial sought more than $20 million in damages, saying that JPMorgan had failed to reveal the apparent violations before the unit's sale, and that the I.R.S., which is now auditing several of its clients, could impose millions of dollars in back taxes and penalties on the corporations. Judge Victor Marrero dismissed the suit, despite evidence that some of the companies were not following I.R.S. regulations. In his ruling in late November, he said NES Financial had not proved it was likely to face losses. Several JPEX employees said at the trial that the company had, in some cases, allowed clients access to money that was supposed to be segregated. I.R.S. officials are reviewing some of the companies that used JPMorgan Chase, according to evidence presented at the trial, though it is not clear which ones. General Electric said it was not the subject of an inquiry. Even as the debate over the tax break continues, there is a deep conviction in the real estate business that it is justified. Advocates for the real estate industry say that a large majority of transactions are conducted in strict compliance with I.R.S. regulations. Because the asset exchanges spur investment and help create jobs, industry officials say they would strenuously oppose any effort to end them. ''Historically, these exchanges are a very important consideration for a very important segment of the economy,'' said Jeffrey D. DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable. ''I have no reason to believe that Congress won't ultimately recognize that.''LOS ANGELES -- Some significant players in the usually quiet movie soundtrack business are about to turn up the volume. Over the holidays, the Cutting Edge Group, a company in London that provides and invests in music for the screen, and its partner Wood Creek Capital Management acquired a well-known purveyor of soundtracks: the Varèse Sarabande record label. The acquisition was disclosed in interviews last week with executives involved in the transaction. They declined to discuss the terms of the deal, but described it as an initial step in using about $100 million in funds that will extend the reach of Cutting Edge, beginning with the purchase and expansion of Varése Sarabande, which will quickly increase its output by half to at least 60 soundtracks a year. The financing will come from Wood Creek, which is based in Connecticut, and from two additional backers, Octopus Investments and Aberdeen Asset Management, which are based in Britain and are otherwise involved with Cutting Edge. ''When you deploy $100 million in this space, that's an awful lot of money,'' said Philip Moross, the chief executive of Cutting Edge. Mr. Moross, who spoke by telephone on Thursday, referred to a movie music business in which the budgets for film scores have dwindled, as inexpensive or stolen downloads knocked the bottom out of soundtrack sales. The music for ''The Bodyguard'' from 1992, which starred Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, sold about 12 million albums in the United States, for instance; but more recent hits, like the ''Twilight'' soundtrack, have sold a fraction of that number. Cutting Edge has grown by spreading its portfolio to include the management of music rights, the representation of composers, and upfront investment in the music for many films. By spending a relatively modest sum for rights to the music of films like ''The King's Speech'' while they are still in production, for example, Cutting Edge helps to underwrite a stronger soundtrack. It can then recoup its money through aggressive sales of the music to advertisers and others. Varése Sarabande, which released its first album in 1978, was founded in Los Angeles by the entrepreneur Chris Kuchler and others, and did well by specializing in what larger competitors had left behind. (The label's unusual name, born of a merger between the predecessor Varése International with Sarabande Records, combines the name of the composer Edgard Varése with the term for a Spanish dance.) Its recent soundtracks include music from ''The Bourne Legacy,'' ''The Help,'' and the second season of HBO's ''Game of Thrones'' The company has focused largely on scores, rather than on song compilations that require the acquisition of expensive rights. Varése Sarabande releases about 40 soundtracks a year. But that number will quickly grow to 60 or more, said Darren Blumenthal, a Los Angeles investment adviser who introduced Mr. Moross to Mr. Kuchler, and will now become chief executive of Varése Sarabande. Mr. Kuchler, who was the principal owner of Varése Sarabande, will stay with the label at least through a transition period of several months, and Robert Townson, its managing director, is expected to remain in place. ''Being together is better for both of us,'' Mr. Kuchler said in an e-mail on Saturday. ''They needed us to round out our operation, and we needed them because things have been getting difficult in our niche area of the music industry.'' Mr. Blumenthal, who spoke jointly with Mr. Moross on Thursday, said the decision to sell came slowly for Mr. Kuchler, who turned down a parade of potential buyers over the last five years. Mr. Moross, said Mr. Blumenthal, began negotiating with Mr. Kuchler about two years ago. And the deal finally closed in late December, as entrepreneurs across the United States were busy selling assets in advance of an anticipated increase in federal taxes. Mr. Kuchler turned away most potential buyers, Mr. Blumenthal said, because they were ''financial, versus strategic.'' The strategic advantage in joining with Cutting Edge, he said, includes an expectation that all or most of the five dozen films with which Cutting Edge is involved annually will now release a score via Varése Sarabande. Thus, ''Side Effects,'' which was directed by Steven Soderbergh and is set for release on Feb. 8 by Open Road Films, was made with input from Cutting Edge, which invested in the music, helped find the music supervisor, and will now release its score, by Thomas Newman, on Varése Sarabande. Mr. Moross and Mr. Blumenthal also talk of expanding Varése Sarabande's existing events business, which has regularly staged concerts at festivals and elsewhere in recent years. That could mean having film scores conducted by their composers at the Hollywood Bowl, for instance, then selling recordings of the performance, Mr. Moross said. It is just one way, he added, of getting more value from scores. ''These are highly undervalued properties,'' he said.Two pension funds that agreed to a relatively small settlement with the directors of Bank of America over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch are being ordered by a federal judge to strike a better deal beginning on Monday. The judge, P. Kevin Castel, voiced clear reservations about the $20 million settlement in a ruling on Friday, concluding that fees requested by the lawyers for the two funds could consume ''some, most or all'' of the money. The deal was reached last spring, months before two other pension funds in a separate lawsuit negotiated a $2.4 billion settlement with the bank over the Merrill purchase. Lawyers representing the pension funds in the $20 million settlement -- the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System and the Hollywood Police Officers' Retirement System, of Florida -- last October asked the court to approve payments of as much as $13 million in legal fees, or 65 percent of the amount proposed under the settlement. The pension funds have accused Kenneth D. Lewis, the former chief executive of Bank of America, and his fellow directors of misleading investors about Merrill's deteriorating financial condition. Bank of America's $50 billion purchase of Merrill Lynch was announced by Mr. Lewis in the fall of 2008 as the financial crisis was deepening, and it generated billions of dollars in losses for the bank. Those losses led to Bank of America's second request for bailout money under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In addition to $20 million in cash, the proposed settlement would also require Bank of America to institute corporate governance changes. Among them are an enhanced director-education program and the creation of a new board committee dedicated to oversight of major acquisitions by the company. The case was brought as a so-called derivative action, on behalf of the bank itself. In a deposition, Mr. Lewis testified that before Bank of America stockholders voted to approve the acquisition he received loss estimates relating to Merrill that were far greater than those reflected in the merger documents filed with regulators. Shareholders rely on statements made in these filings to decide whether to approve transactions their companies have proposed; companies must disclose facts that could be meaningful for shareholders as they weigh voting on a deal. Given these and other facts of the various litigations, the shareholders who filed the parallel case in Delaware against the bank's directors objected to the terms of the $20 million settlement. In court filings, lawyers representing these shareholders said that representatives of the Louisiana and Florida plaintiffs had done little investigation, deposing only two of the bank's directors, and failed to ascertain whether the board had sufficient assets to contribute to a settlement. The lawyers in the Delaware case also argued in court that the $20 million settlement was grossly inadequate because of $500 million in directors' and officers' insurance purchased by Bank of America that is available to satisfy the matter. In addition, the lawyers said, the directors are not contributing personally to the settlement in spite of having the financial resources to do so. Directors are rarely held personally liable in lawsuits against companies. In addition to these objections, the lawyers in the Delaware case noted that the $20 million is far lower than the $150 million fine paid by the bank in 2010 to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the Merrill acquisition. Amid these arguments, Bank of America settled another class-action case in September involving the same allegations about the Merrill purchase. Under that deal, the bank agreed to pay $2.4 billion, dwarfing the amount the Louisiana and Florida plaintiffs had settled for in April. The $2.4 billion settlement was brought by lawyers representing public pension funds in Ohio and Texas. That case was also heard by Judge Castel. Another possible sticking point in the proposed $20 million settlement is how much of the money will go to the lawyers representing the Louisiana and Florida pension funds. Last October, those lawyers asked the court to approve payments of as much as $13 million in legal fees, or 65 percent of the amount proposed under the settlement. Late Friday, Judge Castel voiced clear reservations on the deal, writing, ''The court has not yet been persuaded of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of a settlement of the derivative claims against defendant Lewis in exchange for corporate governance reforms of unquantifiable value and $20 million in cash, some, most or all of which may be consumed by plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.'' Joseph E. White III, a lawyer at Saxena White who represents the Louisiana and Florida pension funds, did not immediately return a phone call or respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Sunday.There are two kinds of cable channels in the United States: those operated by major media companies that have dozens of other channels, and those that are on their own. The outlets in the second group, the independent channels, are feeling threatened these days. Some of the distributors they depend on -- Time Warner Cable, DirecTV, Verizon FiOS -- are talking about dropping underperforming channels from their lineups, or at least paying them less. Al Gore's low-rated Current TV, for example, was at risk of being dropped when it decided to sell to Al Jazeera last week and was, in fact, dropped by Time Warner on New Year's Day. Distributors have talked for years about belt-tightening, but two things are different now: potential Web competitors are creeping up and programming costs are soaring, particularly for sports channels and broadcasters. ''We are having to take a very hard look at our lineup, not unlike a network that takes a hard look at its lineup when deciding what shows it will put on the air,'' said Melinda Witmer, who oversees Time Warner Cable's negotiations with channel owners. She predicted more changes in the future that would ''enable us to buy the stuff that we've really got to have, and let go of stuff that's not really moving the dial.'' In practice, independently owned channels are more imperiled than those owned by media conglomerates like the Walt Disney Company and Viacom. ''Many lesser networks owned by the large content companies are tied to carriage of their more valuable services,'' said Dan York, who oversees programming deals for DirecTV. VH1 Classic and ESPNU aren't going away anytime soon. But on New Year's Day, Verizon FiOS withdrew Youtoo TV, a fledgling channel that features videos submitted by viewers, and Time Warner Cable dropped Ovation, which bills itself as an arts and culture channel. Ovation ''is viewed by less than 1 percent of our customers on any given day,'' the distributor said in December when it announced the change, adding, ''They've had ample opportunity to improve the ratings and the content, and have failed to deliver.'' Even if obscure channels like Ovation receive only a nickel a month for every customer, those nickels still add up to tens of millions of dollars in costs incurred by distributors and, indirectly, their subscribers. Of the 10 distributors that together account for 90 percent of TV subscriptions in the United States, Time Warner Cable is taking the most aggressive public stance against low-rated channels like Ovation. Programming costs in general are ''out of whack,'' the distributor's chief executive, Glenn Britt, told investors last month, citing a 30 percent increase in the subscriber fees paid to channel owners since 2008. Mr. Britt has been outspoken about limiting price increases to retain customers who otherwise might eliminate cable. When Time Warner Cable warned that it might drop Current last month, it also singled out low-rated channels like Hallmark, IFC, Lifetime, NHL Network, the Style Network and WE tv. But to date, none except for Current and Ovation have been dropped by Time Warner. And new channels continue to be given a chance: Time Warner Cable started to carry BBC World News and RLTV, formerly called Retirement Living TV, in the last few months. Some programmers say that's proof that the distributors are just making empty gestures to Wall Street, talking tough about programming costs but not following through. Chad Gutstein, the chief operating officer of Ovation, said he did not know why his channel was dropped, ''but I do know this: What they say they're doing, they're clearly not doing.'' ''They're actually doing things to increase their programming cost growth, to drive those costs up for all the other distributors in the marketplace,'' Mr. Gutstein said, by starting an expensive regional sports channel in Southern California, for instance. But channels with exclusive sports rights are crucial, even though they may make profitable distributors feel impoverished. ''Any given one may not have a huge amount of viewership relative to a national service, but if you lose that team, you're losing subscribers,'' said Ms. Witmer of Time Warner Cable. Dave Shull, who oversees Dish Network's programming deals, said that ''with sports costs increasing so much, including the Time Warner products, I think everyone's aware that they have to cut costs elsewhere to be able to afford those sports products.'' So what's a tiny channel to do? Some analysts have suggested that low-rated cable channels should remake themselves as freely available channels on the Web, modeled after channels that YouTube is financing. YouTube channel owners make money from advertising but not subscriber fees. Another model may entail Web subscriptions, something Glenn Beck pioneered with an online channel called TheBlaze. The owner of the Hallmark Channel recently started an online subscription service like Netflix for its library of Hallmark Hall of Fame movies. But at the same time, many online channels, TheBlaze included, are trying to squeeze onto cable and satellite systems, since the vast majority of video viewing still happens on the TV set, not the Web. Over all, little has changed in the last few years: no major content player has gone ''a la carte'' and let subscribers choose only the channels they want to have and no one has started a virtual cable company on the Internet, despite efforts by Intel, Sony and other technology companies to do so. The television ecosystem, which at times has seemed close to its breaking point, has not broken. Both programmers and distributors have found it in their best interests to keep it intact. Last week, for instance, the 11th-biggest distributor in the country, Suddenlink, was caught up in a fee fight with Fox Networks, the cable unit of the News Corporation. Suddenlink proposed that Fox could set prices for each of its channels, big ones like FX and tiny ones like Fox Soccer and Fuel, and then customers could choose to pay for only the ones they wanted. Suddenlink publicized the offer, calling it ''an attempt to respond to what our customers have said they wanted.'' But Fox refused the offer. Four hours later, the companies said they had reached an agreement in principle to keep all the channels -- and thus keep the system intact.As told to Patricia R. Olsen.  IN the late 1940s, my parents migrated from the South to the North, seeking opportunity. That word, opportunity, has been a shaper of my life. My family lived through the civil rights era, in which many Americans tried to right the wrongs of social injustice. My parents believed that things would change for minorities and that there would be opportunity for those who were ready. They stressed that my siblings and I get ready, through education. As a child in Ohio, I delivered The Dayton Daily News. At 13, I was named newspaper delivery boy of the year; my picture was on the front page. I later worked in the circulation department until I left for college. When I was a senior in high school, the General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, was diversifying. My counselor recommended that I attend G.M.I., but I told her I was interested in studying computer science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. My counselor went so far as to fill out a G.M.I. application and slip it into my locker. I signed it and sent it in just to have her leave me alone. Soon after, G.M.I. sent me an acceptance letter. Attending G.M.I. worked out well because I didn't know how I would pay for Miami, and the institute had a cooperative program in which I attended classes for six weeks, then worked for six weeks. After graduating in 1976, I worked at G.M. as a production engineer, making steering wheels. A year later, I became a front line supervisor. I loved the manufacturing floor and learning about different operations. A majority of my crew were women, who helped me learn the job. I learned that people want to help one another. You're responsible for a job, but you can't do it alone. One of my later assignments as production manager was to help turn around a G.M. operation in Portugal. It was a chance to make a difference and I seized it, yet I recall thinking as the plane took off for Lisbon, ''What have I done?'' But I loved the assignment. My family and I traveled extensively in Europe in the three years I was there. After returning from Portugal in 1987, I accepted my first executive assignment, as general superintendent of manufacturing in Canada. In 1991, I attended a Sloan executive program at Stanford for a master of science in management degree. In 1997, G.M. appointed me as vice president and general manager of Delphi interior and safety systems, a division of Delphi Automotive Systems, its parts maker. Two years later it spun off Delphi. When my colleagues and I were contemplating whether to move to the new company, I said, ''Let's go for it.'' I've always loved a good journey. I was promoted twice more before becoming president and chief operating officer in 2005. . That was the same year we filed for Chapter 11 reorganization because our performance was continuing to deteriorate. We needed to preserve the value of the company before it deteriorated any further. In 2007, I was named Delphi's C.E.O. and remained president as well. The reorganization was one of the largest in the nation's industrial history. We focused our portfolio on 33 core product lines, down from 131, and emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 as a leaner, more product-focused, high-tech company. We had taken a formerly unprofitable subsidiary, geared to one North American customer, and made it a diversified growth company with over 100,000 employees in over 30 countries. Even though I've been at G.M. and Delphi my entire career, it feels as if I've been at several companies because I've worked in so many areas. My career is an example of taking advantage of opportunities when they come along. In November 2011, I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark Delphi's initial public offering. I remember standing there thinking that we had seized our opportunity.AS the founder and president of the Bronx Pro Group, a family-run, neighborhood-based company in Morris Park that builds, renovates and manages low- and moderate-income housing in the Bronx, Peter Magistro, 63, has seen the borough struggle and come back to life. A Bronx native and longtime resident who now lives on the Upper West Side, he has an intimate knowledge of local housing trends. He knows where the Bronx has been and where it's headed. Q Tell us about your background. A My grandparents came from Italy, and I grew up in a two-room walk-up in the Westchester Square section. I majored in economics at Fordham and have a master's in finance. I spent 12 years at Citibank, working mostly in financial control and real estate. Q How did you get into the real estate business? A In 1973, when I was 24, I bought my first building with my dad, an old six-family apartment house north of Fordham Road for $60,000, as an investment. I kept buying residential buildings in the Bronx. In 1998 I got a chance to renovate 185 units of housing in the Bronx. Since then I've built or renovated over 1,300 apartments, everything from town houses to high-rise apartment buildings. We also manage 1,800 apartments in 64 buildings. Thanks to a variety of government programs, including tax credits and capital funds, we can provide quality housing at affordable rents. We mostly offer family-sized apartments that rent for an average of under $1,000 a month. Q Who lives in your buildings? A Mostly working families with a wide range of incomes. A typical family of four renting a two-bedroom apartment could earn from $44,000 to $86,000 a year. Q Let's say you're a student, or retired or have a young family, and you want to move to the Bronx. What neighborhoods should you think about? A The West Bronx has a lot of attractions. Subway service is excellent, the buildings are solid in a way they don't build anymore, and there's a retail strip along Fordham Road. To the north are a number of affluent bedroom communities, like Riverdale and Pelham Manor. And there are emerging areas in the South Bronx that offer good transportation, including High Bridge, which includes Yankee Stadium, and Melrose, which includes the Hub. Q What are the pluses and minuses of living in the Bronx these days? A The main plus is that you can find an affordable, family-sized apartment in a well-constructed building. Bronx apartments are roomy, and the buildings have good bones. Many neighborhoods have great subway service, and there's plenty of shopping. The Bronx also has remarkable attractions like the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Garden, Wave Hill, terrific parks where you can play golf or picnic, beaches and our very own Bronx Riviera -- Orchard Beach and City Island. You can have one of the best Italian meals in New York on Arthur Avenue, our Little Italy. But some amenities need to catch up. We don't have enough of the large Manhattan-style supermarkets or chain stores. There could be more bank branches and more specialty coffee shops. Certain areas are in a two-fare subway zone and may require a car. The social needs are a challenge, as they are citywide. In our developments, we're addressing this challenge through community facilities that provide after-school programs, day care facilities and senior centers. Q Who's moving to the Bronx these days? A Newcomers include people who are coming to the West Bronx from Washington Heights, where they're getting priced out. People from Manhattan and Brooklyn have applied to live in our moderate-income buildings. We also see applicants from New Jersey who work in the city and want an easier commute. Q Many New Yorkers don't know much about the Bronx, but in their opinion, it's a violent place. What's your answer to them? A What's different since the '70s, when that attitude developed, is that now people want to live here. They're not running away from the Bronx; some are even running to the Bronx. I think today's Bronx is very much like the Bronx that I experienced growing up, essentially a melting pot of people who settle here to make a better life for themselves and their families. That's what defines the Bronx. Maybe there's not a Starbucks on every corner, but there is a rich variety of people and experiences. Q Will the Bronx ever shake its negative portrait in Tom Wolfe's novel ''The Bonfire of the Vanities''? A Who sees it that way? I don't think anyone does anymore, unless they're not informed. And the proof is in the pudding, because when we market a new development, we receive thousands of applications from all parts of the city. It shows that with attention and investment, perceptions shift over time. Q If you could fix one thing about the Bronx, what would it be? A It would be to eradicate any lingering reputation of the Bronx made famous in the '60s and '70s and that was further dramatized by movies. In recent years, the Bronx has made substantial progress through investments made under the mayor's new housing marketplace plan, which has created safe and secure housing for people. Misperceptions about the Bronx have delayed us from reaching our full potential. But time really does heal all wounds, and people eventually forget. The Lower East Side, Harlem and certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn experienced similar devastation and notoriety, and they have succeeded in changing. The Bronx is a diamond in the rough, being discovered. Q Gentrification often seems to start after artists colonize a neighborhood. Is that happening in the Bronx? A Not much, which is a shame. For a while there was an opportunity in the South Bronx, but the economic downturn crushed that. Eventually, however, artists will cross the river. And if we invest in housing that addresses their needs, it could help attract them. I believe the potential is there. Look at SoHo and TriBeCa. Look at what they were and what they've become. Q What's been the impact of buildings in the Bronx by star architects like Rafael Viñoly, who designed the Bronx Hall of Justice on 161st Street, just off the Grand Concourse, and Arquitectonica, responsible for the expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts? A They've created an architectural buzz and interest in this part of the city. They change perception. We should have more such projects. Q In terms of safety, a sense of community and great restaurants, Arthur Avenue has always been a successful Bronx neighborhood. Could it be replicated elsewhere in the borough? A Part of the neighborhood's longevity and mystique is rooted in its historic and ethnic origins. I remember my mother shopping at the Arthur Avenue market when the streets were lined with pushcarts. Perhaps the new immigrants will create their own Arthur Avenue rooted in their traditions and culture. I'm not sure that isn't already happening. Q For families thinking about moving to the Bronx, what's the takeaway? A The Bronx is a growing and vibrant place. Sure, there are trade-offs. But on balance our neighborhoods are safe and prospering. A family of four earning under $86,000 can find affordable housing in an apartment as big as many houses and in a building with character. Where else in the city can you find this? Q Is it true that every Thanksgiving you deliver turkeys to the families who live in your buildings? A Yes. This year we delivered almost 1,400 turkeys to our tenants and other members of our community.LAMBERTVILLE, N.J. -- When Sean Hanrahan and Nina Sassano, both of Freehold, bought tickets to the River Horse Brewing Company's oatmeal milk stout release party here last month, they noticed on Facebook that it was the first time the brewery was holding such an event, Ms. Sassano said. But they did not realize that a change in New Jersey law governing microbreweries had made such gatherings possible. ''It's probably because other breweries we've gone to are in Pennsylvania or Delaware, like Dogfish Head,'' which has its brewery in Milton, Del., Mr. Hanrahan said. On-site events at microbreweries at which craft beers may be sold by the glass or pint have long been popular in those states. But in New Jersey, before September, microbreweries could not sell their products for consumption on the premises. Now they can, though they cannot serve food, and visitors must participate in a tour in order to imbibe. Microbreweries were also prevented from selling more than two six-packs of beer to go. Now, customers may buy up to a keg, equal to 15.5 gallons of beer, directly from a microbrewery. ''People would come from out of state for a tour of a New Jersey winery and they'd buy a couple of cases of wine. And then they'd say, 'Let's go hit the brewery,' '' said Gene Muller, owner of the Flying Fish Brewing Company, a microbrewery in Somerdale. But they would be unable to buy more than two six-packs. ''Our consumers are really engaged with craft beer, and this allows them to buy it fresh,'' he said. ''They want those bragging rights, that it's fresh from the brewery.'' Mr. Muller, 56, of Haddon Township, was one of the most visible proponents of relaxing the laws, along with Mark Edelson, co-owner of the Iron Hill Brewery and Restaurant chain, based in Wilmington, Del. Brew pubs, like Iron Hill, are distinct from microbreweries in that they are restaurants that also brew beer on site. Before September, they were legally bound to sell their beer only on their own property, not at liquor stores, other bar-restaurants or off-site festivals. Now, they can do all those things. Brew-pub licensees were also allowed to open only two brew pubs within New Jersey; now they may own up to 10. And each brew pub may produce up to 10,000 barrels of beer annually, up from 3,000. ''New Jersey was the most restrictive state for us, and it still is, even after this,'' said Mr. Edelson, 48, of Landenberg, Pennsylvania. Iron Hill currently operates nine brew pubs in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey (in Maple Shade). Mr. Edelson and his partners plan to open a second location in New Jersey -- in Voorhees -- this summer and are looking for a third location in the state. Other brew-pub owners, including Daniel Soboti, Jr., co-owner of the Gaslight Brewery and Restaurant in South Orange, are shopping for distributors to sell their beer to liquor stores and other restaurants. And Charlie Schroeder, the brewer at the Trap Rock Restaurant and Brewery in Berkeley Heights, said his restaurant planned to double the size of its brewery this year so it could supply other restaurants owned by its parent company, Harvest Restaurants, of Morris Plains, with craft beers. The easing of restrictions came at a welcome time for Flying Fish, which moved to Somerdale from Cherry Hill in 2012, increasing its space to 45,000 square feet from 13,000, a step that was planned before the law was changed. The reason for scaling up was not to provide more room for pint-buying beer drinkers to mingle on site, Mr. Muller said. ''We're not trying to run a bar -- running a brewery is hard enough,'' said Mr. Muller. The growth is for production purposes, he said, because ''we've been at our limit, making as much as we can make, for the last three years.'' Still, the new Flying Fish includes a not-yet-complete tasting room costing $250,000 and scheduled for an April opening that ''will allow us to accommodate tourists nicely,'' he said. The beers served in the state's tasting rooms may also improve in quality and variety, now that they are more accessible to the public, said Gregory Zaccardi, president of the High Point Brewing Company in Butler. Mr. Zaccardi, 44, of Montclair, has held two events for limited-run beers by Ramstein, his label, at High Point since the changes, including a December party for a Holiday Special Dark Cherry Belgian Ale. He sees them as an opportunity to ''really refine what you're making,'' he said. ''Because people are right there telling you what they think.'' Mr. Muller expects more microbreweries to sprout in New Jersey now that the state offers a ''better business environment,'' he said. ''Especially for small guys, just being able to get that cash flow makes a difference.'' It does for Michael Kane, who opened the Kane Brewing Company, a microbrewery, in Ocean Township in 2011. ''We've been surprised at how much revenue we've been able to generate just from selling kegs and pints in the tasting room,'' said Mr. Kane, 36, of Atlantic Highlands. ''Not only does it allow us to stay in business; it's also helping to fund some expansion and do stuff we wouldn't have been able to do otherwise, like hire people.'' That is one of the reasons Senator Tom Kean, who Mr. Muller said was among a few state politicians instrumental in having the restrictions eased, supported the changes, which Gov. Chris Christie signed into law on Sept. 19. ''At the beginning of the process, when we first started looking at the laws and saw that some of them were archaic, it seemed like the right thing to do,'' said Mr. Kean, of Westfield. ''By the end of the process, when we saw this had true potential to be an avenue for job growth, we were convinced it was the right thing to do,'' he added.

Following are edited excerpts of reader comments from nytimes.com: I'm sad that all of these lovely buildings are stuck facing a parking garage across the street! Vicki Nevada After spending several years in Europe in the U.S. Air Force during the cold war[1958-63], I was fortunate to visit Amsterdam many times. In fact I met my wife, Elizabeth, in Eindhoven, Holland. The architecture and art of Amsterdam, specially the Golden Period [17th century], is as spectacular as any European capital. We Americans, to this day, do not appreciate its history and early relationship to America. Remember, New York [New Amsterdam] was founded by the Dutch. Ernest Velasquez Fresno, Calif. New Amsterdam caught my attention as I visited New Amsterdam in Suriname, South America, not too long ago. Color Grower Vancouver BC If you want a sense of how thorough a restoration this was, go to Google Maps street view for an older picture of the building. Dan Providence, UT The 1839 house at 19 South William Street may seem plain jane compared to its more elaborate stepped-gable neighbors, but to my eye it is the best of the lot. The building's Greek Revival lines are pure and symmetrical; its beauty not reliant on applied ornamentation but distilled in the rectitude of its proportions and materials. Note the logarithmic reduction in window heights with each rising story, preventing that feeling of top-heaviness so prevalent in buildings of our less discriminating age. And the contrast of the monolithic granite base against the fine, warm texture of the brick above. It is a miracle when houses like this survive (lo, with scars honorably won) in the city where rebuilding never sleeps. Highest marks to those with the taste and energy to restore it. Cochecho Dover, NH A GERMAN BEER HALL! on the ground floor! Oh, no! Those poor folks living in the apartments above it will not be pleased. But it certainly is a lovely restoration. So glad NYC can be a mix of old and new ... and not have these gems torn down and replaced with a high glass tower, etc. Far better to have an art gallery on the ground floor or a boutique ... or a bakery. A business that maybe harks back to the original use of the building? Alas! If the lease has been signed ... but ''German beer hall'' brings to mind loud music and badly sung music ... try and close doors at midnight ... for the sake of the neighborhood! Helen Byrne Arizona I've always found it terribly sad that our New Amsterdam architectural heritage was so thoroughly erased, which is why, of course, this has long been one of my favorite blocks. It makes it easy to imagine what we might have had over a larger area were it not for fires and destructive development. (I'm not against development; I just want it to make occasional allowances for history and heritage.) Thanks for explaining the origins of these charming structures. Moshe Flushing, NY Yes, I've always felt very sad about that myself. Imagine if just one piece of the 17th-century city could have been preserved! Denise San FranciscoAlex Stone is the author of ''Fooling Houdini: Magicians, Mentalists, Math Geeks and the Hidden Powers of the Mind.''  WHAT do you get when you cross a fragrance with an actor? Answer: a smell Gibson. Groan away, but you should know that this joke was written by a computer. ''Smell Gibson'' is the C.P.U. child of something called Standup (for System to Augment Non-Speakers' Dialogue Using Puns), a program that generates punning riddles to help kids with language disabilities increase their verbal skills. Though it's not quite Louis C. K., the Standup program, engineered by a team of computer scientists in Scotland, is one of the more successful efforts to emerge from a branch of artificial intelligence known as computational humor, which seeks to model comedy using machines. As verbal interaction between humans and computers becomes more prominent in daily life -- from Siri, Apple's voice-activated assistant technology, to speech-based search engines to fully automated call centers -- demand has grown for ''social computers'' that can communicate with humans in a natural way. Teaching computers to grapple with humor is a key part of this equation. ''Humor is everywhere in human life,'' says the Purdue computer scientist Julia M. Taylor, who helped organize the first-ever United States symposium on the artificial intelligence of humor, in November. If we want a computational system to communicate with human life, it needs to know how to be funny, she says. As it turns out, this is one of the most challenging tasks in computer science. Like much of language, humor is loaded with abstraction and ambiguity. To understand it, computers need to contend with linguistic sleights like irony, sarcasm, metaphor, idiom and allegory -- things that don't readily translate into ones and zeros. On top of that, says Lawrence J. Mazlack of the University of Cincinnati, a seminal figure in the field of computational linguistics, humor is context-dependent: what's funny in one situation may not be funny in another. As an example, he cites Henny Youngman's signature line, ''Take my wife -- please,'' which came about by accident when an usher seating Youngman's wife mistook the comedian's request for a gag. The cognitive processes that cause people to snicker at this sort of one-liner are only partly understood, which makes it all the more difficult for computers to mimic them. Unlike, say, chess, which is grounded in a fixed set of rules, there are no hard-and-fast formulas for comedy. To get around that cognitive complexity, computational humor researchers have by and large taken a more concrete approach: focusing on simple linguistic relationships, like double meanings, rather than on trying to model the high-level mental mechanics that underlie humor. Standup, for instance, writes jokes by searching through a ''lexical database'' (basically, a huge dictionary) for words that fit linguistic patterns found in puns -- phonetic and semantic similarities, mostly -- and comes up with doozies like: ''What do you call a fish tank that has a horn? A goldfish bull.'' Another tack has been to apply machine-learning algorithms, which crunch mountains of data to identify statistical features that can be used to classify text as funny or unfunny. This is more or less how spam filters work: they decide which messages to tag by analyzing billions of e-mails and compiling a database of red flags (like any urgent message from a deposed Nigerian prince). Figuring out when a joke is a joke is where artificial intelligence researchers have made, perhaps, the most progress. For her Ph.D. dissertation, Dr. Taylor built a system that could identify children's jokes out of various selections of prose with remarkable accuracy. Not only that, but it could also explain why it found something funny, which suggests that on some level it ''got'' the jokes. In a related experiment, the computer scientists Rada Mihalcea at the University of North Texas, Denton, and Carlo Strapparava, now at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Italy, trained computers to separate humorous one-liners from nonhumorous sentences borrowed from Reuters headlines, proverbs and other texts. By analyzing the content and style of these sentences, the program was able to spot the jokes with an average accuracy of 87 percent. Putting such research to good use, a pair of wags at the University of Washington last year taught a computer when to use the refrain ''That's what she said'' -- theirs being one of the few academic papers to cite ''The Office'' among its references. Some will surely wonder if the point of such research goes beyond devising software that can make the C++ set crack up at hackathons. Thankfully, it does. The goal of computational humor, and of computational linguistics as a whole, is to design machines akin to the shipboard computer on ''Star Trek'' -- ones that can answer open-ended questions and carry on casual conversations with human beings, even William Shatner. In the process, scientists hope to gain insights into the nature of humor: Why do we laugh at certain things and not at others? Why does anyone watch ''Two and a Half Men''? If computer humorists can answer any of these questions, we won't just get a deeper understanding of how language works but also, ultimately, what it means to be human.Steven Smith stands on the refuse that, no matter what, always seems to regenerate in the South Bronx. Plastic soda bottles, soccer balls, a thermos and a faded life preserver poke out from under the wooden planks scattered on the eroded shores of the East River. This is Oak Point, west of Hunts Point, a peninsula of perpetual reinvention. Once home to colonial estates and a Cuban sugar importer, then a public beach, a railroad float yard, a city landfill during the Bronx's burning years, an illegal dumping ground tied to the mob, a proposed power plant and a jail, Oak Point, which Mr. Smith developed, now features a $60 million warehouse supplying food to bodegas and restaurants. For three months the waterfront on the 28-acre site was also home to a wetland with verdant slopes and grassy marshes. Paradise in the Bronx. And then it was all lost: two years of planning, nine months of work, $1.5 million and three acres of wetlands washed away in a matter of hours by Hurricane Sandy's 13-foot storm surge. What remain are a few patches of marsh grass, a Charlie Brown-like evergreen and one lonely, weedy mound just below a concrete wall. Mr. Smith has to rebuild. But how? ''This has to be done properly,'' he said, shaking his head. ''This is an environmental disaster. And you don't want to repeat this mistake again.'' Forgive Mr. Smith's passion. The shoreline destruction at Oak Point is not exactly on a scale with the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but the ruined habitat can provide a prism for the city's post-hurricane rebuilding concerns -- sustainability, resilience and economic development. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said last month that the city would examine different methods to fortify the coast, but he did not offer specifics. Before the storm, the city and its parks department began restoring 127 acres of wetlands throughout the city, while a complementary pilot project was planned to redevelop 10 acres of wetlands in hopes of spurring business along the shoreline. Especially since Hurricane Katrina, scientists have debated the role of wetlands in storms. The vegetation can produce friction to slow down wave energy, but marine biologists say the amount of protection depends on the acreage, the location and the surrounding infrastructure. Not to mention the size of the storm. At Oak Point, Mr. Smith reached an agreement with the State Department of Environmental Conservation: In exchange for developing the property, he would work with the agency to build wetlands. The purpose was to beautify the shoreline, create a haven for day-tripping birds coming from the North and South Brother Islands nearby, and stop silt or contaminants from seeping into the East River. Kelly Risotto, whose Land Use Ecological Services designed the habitat, said that in addition to the sheer size of the storm, a reason the plantings were washed away was probably that they had not yet taken root -- the marsh grasses were already submerged as the storm approached. Ms. Risotto said her company, based in Medford on Long Island, would replant in the spring. A spokeswoman for the Environmental Conservation Department said it was still evaluating plans for the wetlands. Said Mr. Smith, ''It would be insanity to rebuild it exactly as we did.'' But S. Jeffress Williams, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey, said: ''The cost of the structures you need to prevent a 15-foot storm surge would be in the tens of millions of dollars. You get what you pay for.'' Mr. Smith, 59, is somewhat of a rare bird in the Bronx. Raised in a log cabin in Greenwood Lake, N.Y., he became an engineer for a Swiss power company wanting to build a plant on the abandoned garbage dump at Oak Point. When the company dropped its plans after the site's owners, Britestarr Homes, went bankrupt, Mr. Smith left his job and bought the property in 2002. He put himself in debt up to $60 million on the morning of his wedding. He signed the Oak Point deal in his tuxedo. It took seven years to clean the 50-foot-high piles of trash dumped by Britestarr, which was investigated for its connections to John A. Gotti, son of the former Gambino crime boss. Mr. Smith found no bodies in the trash heap, he said, but five handguns. He paid off Britestarr's debts and rented land to landscapers and construction firms. After his own proposal to build a power plant on the site was defeated, he joined Hunts Point neighbors in opposing a city-proposed jail. Then Mr. Smith sold 12 acres to Jetro Holdings, a national food distribution company, for $25 million in 2010. Jetro's warehouse now serves restaurants and neighborhood markets across the city, offering an array of fresh and frozen foods, packaged goods and alcohol. Kellie Terry-Sepulveda, the executive director of the Point, a Hunts Point group for youth programs and economic development, said that after a decade of proposals for Oak Point, she was pleased with Mr. Smith's shoreline plan. ''Oftentimes developers here take the road that will make the most money,'' she said. ''That's what special about Steve's project: it was an added value, something that was looking to help the environment.'' Mr. Smith, who lives on wetlands in Brick, N.J., hired graduates of a job-training program from Sustainable South Bronx, another local nonprofit organization, to plant trees and shrubs. One graduate, Devorah Gross, 56, worked eight-hour shifts for six weeks this summer planting sumac, river birch, roses for the bees, juniper berries for the birds. She was thrilled to see the ecosystem transformed, and was crushed when Mr. Smith sent her pictures after the storm. ''Oh, 'sad' is an understatement,'' Ms. Gross said. ''It broke my heart. We worked so hard and we were so happy to see wildlife coming back in a positive mode. We were starting to see baby fish and crab and swans and ducks.'' Ms. Gross said she could see the marsh grasses grasping oil from the water, acting like a filter. ''It was such an education,'' she said. The project had two components. Mr. Smith removed the decaying wood bulkheads and other debris from the former float yard -- where railroads brought in freight cars by boat -- but kept three existing piers. Inland, he expanded the intertidal marsh wetlands, formed three beaches and brought in 6,000 yards of sand as a foundation. On the remaining two acres, he made a buffer habitat of shrubs, trees and grasses. On the corner of the peninsula, where currents had converged for centuries, he persuaded the state to approve of piling boulders in a riprap. Those remained after the storm, as did the mile-long, 15-foot-high cast-concrete wall lining the property to prevent flooding. Based on what survived, Mr. Smith advocates rebuilding by integrating, or layering, hard and soft materials. He has a wider vision, though, beyond the waterfront, for his remaining 13 acres. He plans a three-level ''food campus'' for a wholesale farmers' market for New York State growers, a rooftop greenhouse, a kitchen incubator and public space overlooking the water. In December, Oak Point's second phase (projected at $80 million) received a $400,000 economic development grant from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Smith also wants to have an information kiosk on the property, displaying the rusty handguns and the quartz sandstone rocks he excavated, and perhaps showing his time-lapse video of the initial wetlands project. For that purpose, he bought from the old rail yards a New Haven Line caboose, now sitting on makeshift tracks. Mr. Smith wants someone to refashion it. ''You know that show, 'Pimp My Ride'?'' he said, referring to the former MTV series. ''I want to find someone to 'Pimp My Caboose,' '' he said with a laugh. The property, like the borough these days, is undergoing a makeover. ''On the tomb of the old Bronx, we're building the new Bronx,'' he said.Google scored a big victory last week when the Federal Trade Commission concluded that the company was not manipulating search results in ways that harmed consumers. But the agency's finding does not completely settle the question of whether the company, which is used for more than 70 percent of all Internet searches in the United States, has abused its dominance. The European Commission and attorneys general in Texas, New York and other states who are also investigating Google could come to very different conclusions about that question. While reaching a settlement with Google on a handful of relatively modest issues, the F.T.C. has left unresolved the legitimate fears that Internet companies like Expedia and Yelp have about how Google uses its power to push into online businesses like travel bookings and restaurant reviews while pushing aside rivals. Even if that does not immediately leave users worse off, Google's critics rightly argue that it could eventually result in fewer choices for consumers if worthy Internet services fail because Google actively makes it difficult for people to find them. Competitors of Google, including Microsoft, have argued that Google often displays search results to highlight its own products, like Google Maps, Google Flights and Google Shopping. They say that by doing so it is acting as Microsoft did in the 1990s when it forced PC makers to pre-install its Internet Explorer software with the Windows operating system at the expense of rivals like Netscape. But the F.T.C. did not buy that argument and concluded that Google had not harmed competition in the marketplace, even if it may have hurt individual rivals. Although Google dominates Internet search today, Web users have many options. And the company's continued dominance is far from assured when it comes to the fast-growing world of smartphones and tablets, where many users download apps without relying on Google. But the company clearly stepped over the line with the practices it has agreed to change. Google will now be required to make it easier for competitors to license certain patents that it had previously agreed to provide. It will also change policies that make it hard for businesses to manage their advertising campaigns on Google and other search engines, and it will give Web sites the ability to opt out of having their content used to bolster its specialized services like Google Local. Fifteen years ago, few people predicted that Microsoft's commanding position would be undercut so drastically by the rise of Google, Apple and others. History, however, is not necessarily prologue to the future. Antitrust regulators must remain watchful that Google does not abuse its dominant position in ways that unfairly limit consumer choices and competition.Readers discuss the skyrocketing prices in today's art market. To the Editor: Wall Street high rollers inflate prices to astronomical levels. Chinese, Russian and Latin American tycoons, eager to find a good place to park their money, horn in on the action. And journalists uncritically gush about ''blue-chip investments'' that many knowledgeable observers consider outright junk. Abstruse derivatives? No. Contemporary art. This November, auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's together brought in $787.3 million. Amid a financial crisis, no less. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought Velázquez's ''Portrait of Juan de Pareja'' for $5.5 million ($31.4 million in 2012 dollars), then the highest price ever paid for a work of art at auction. Scholars recognized the portrait as one of the world's greatest paintings, yet the price, perceived by many as excessive, sparked considerable debate. So how in the world did we get to the point where people pay tens of millions of dollars for works by the likes of Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Damien Hirst? Do the skyrocketing prices reflect, as one might assume in a free market, the connoisseurship of an exclusive clique of brilliant collectors and their prescient art advisers? I think not. Financiers know the value of hype. They understand that if artworks sell at exorbitant prices, those works -- and the artists who created them -- become newsworthy, regardless of whether they're actually any good. And the media play right along, almost never questioning the quality of the works or the abilities of the artists. Historically, time has been very cruel to the reputations of all but the very best artists. But today enormous sums of money are devoted to propping up the star power of a small group of wildly overrated cult figures. Have the masters of the universe created the unpoppable bubble? Or will the child's voice somehow manage to rise above the buzz and proclaim that the emperor is, as many have suspected all along, buck naked? Time will tell. WILLIAM COLE Sitges, Spain, Dec. 28, 2012 The writer is working on a book about art connoisseurship. Readers React Mr. Cole's attack on ''wildly overrated cult figures'' in the arts, and the allegedly gullible patrons who support them, is wildly out of touch with the current circumstances of contemporary art. The age of the heroic individual working in cheap isolation has given way to a far different and more complex system of production and consumption. Many of today's artists are more like the Baroque masters -- Peter Paul Rubens, for example -- in that they must maintain complex production facilities, support a raft of artists and assistants as collaborators, use extraordinarily expensive raw materials, and create monumentally scaled works that have to be transported with great difficulty and expense over great distances to reach their fabulously wealthy patrons or public institutions. Let's do some math. Let's say a ''wildly overrated'' piece sells for $10 million. The gallery pockets half. Now the production costs have to be subtracted. An artist might work for a decade on the prototype for a work that must then be painstakingly cast, fabricated and assembled. Meanwhile the foundry, the gallery and the artist incur continuing costs whether or not the work is successfully sold: insurance, transportation, rigging, maintenance. The artist's share then supports costs for space, staff and materials. What Mr. Cole mischaracterizes is not the quality of individual artists working right now -- certainly many will turn out to be dross, and a few will end up in art history lectures. Instead, he mischaracterizes a new age of artistic production, an age that began in the 1970s and earlier (think of Warhol's Factory!) and has only gained in momentum and substance in the 21st century. PETER BACON HALES Stone Ridge, N.Y., Jan. 2, 2013 The writer is professor emeritus, School of Art and Art History, the University of Illinois at Chicago. Mr. Cole's letter about the art market is an expression of my 2 Percent Theory of Art. The theory states that in any given culture, at any given time, only 2 percent of the art, music and literature being produced is truly great. The theory has two important corollaries. The first is that every generation complains about the amount of junk being produced by comparing the present scene to some purported Golden Age. English professors lament the trashy novels cluttering up the best-seller lists by calling up Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot and Hardy, handily ignoring the hundreds upon hundreds of novels that have rightly been forgotten. There was no Golden Age and there never will be. The second corollary, and more directly to Mr. Cole's point, is that contemporary critics are often wrong about what's great. Yes, Hemingway, Faulkner and Beckett won Nobel Prizes, but so did Henryk Sienkiewicz, Henrik Pontoppidan and Bjornstjerne Bjornson. Who's read them lately? And look who didn't win the prize! Bjornson beat out a fellow Norwegian named Henrik Ibsen. So let the billionaires spend what they will on contemporary art. I am confident that their broke heirs will wonder why they didn't buy government bonds when they had the chance. BRUCE HATTON BOYER Evanston, Ill., Jan. 2, 2013 There have always been bubbles in the art world. From the earliest days of the Renaissance, when art was centered around political power and used as a commodity to be traded and sold, artists and patrons have engaged in an aggressive tango of money and fame. But the question posed by Mr. Cole is less of a debate on when and if this current bubble will pop, and more to do with the prices for the artists he describes as ''wildly overrated cult figures'': Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Damien Hirst. As someone who has devoted her career to postwar and contemporary art and traded hundreds of works by each of these artists, I take issue with Mr. Cole's assessment. The four artists on his list have been commercially successful since they started making art, consistently benefiting from gallery and institutional support. Their ''bubbles'' are more glass, less water. More art is being made today than ever before, and it's true that much of the media spends too much time focusing on superstars. My hope for the new year is that the bubble about the bubble bursts, and we can start focusing on actually supporting the artists, both emerging and established. SARA FRIEDLANDER Vice President, Postwar and Contemporary Art, Christie's New York, Jan. 2, 2013 Mr. Cole's letter is more than just pertinent; it is challenging. It is obvious to me, as a subscriber to several art blogs and arts in education Web sites, that a new specialty in promoting and influencing the sales of minimally valuable ''art'' is being developed as a serious career in the business of art. The courses being touted by universities and art schools describe, in clear language, how to advocate for mediocrity in the art market. A whole new language is being taught to critics and art ''scholars'' for the sole purpose of pushing higher and higher prices for art that ultimately has little value. DONALD WAITS New Orleans, Jan. 2, 2013 The writer is a former public-school teacher of art history and painting. Mr. Cole is absolutely right. Today's art market has nothing to do with art and everything to do with hype, and the media are deplorably complicit in the game. The question to be asked, however, is not simply whether work produced by the likes of Warhol, Koons and Hirst is any good, but whether it qualifies as art at all by any meaningful standard. The answer to that bigger question should be a resounding ''no''! MICHELLE MARDER KAMHI New York, Jan. 3, 2013 The writer is co-editor of Aristos, an online review of the arts, and the co-author of ''What Art Is.'' Mr. Cole makes it quite clear that he considers it scandalous to pay tens of millions of dollars for a Warhol, a Koons or a Hirst. He seems less outraged that a Velázquez is valued the same as a Hirst than he is by the fact that paintings garner great sums of money. Tens of millions? For a painting? Both ethically and economically, I'd say after doing one's philanthropic duty, collecting art is one of the best ways to spend a fortune. Provided you understand what you're buying. A Warhol is not a Koons is not a Hirst is not a Velázquez. Anyone gullible enough to purchase a Hirst at current market value is a fool. Anyone who buys a Koons is on much safer ground. The ground gets even firmer beneath a Velázquez. But to dismiss Warhol as the invention of financiers' hype is misguided. Simply put, he is one of the most important artists of the last century. This is not to suggest that Mr. Cole is wrong about hype. He's just wrong about Warhol. Some art is of undeniable value. Other art is not. Some of it is downright fraudulent. There is work being done today that will compel viewers for hundreds of years. The work of James Turrell, Pierre Huyghe, Sigmar Polke and Anselm Kiefer will endure, just like that of Goya, Giotto and Van Gogh. Much of the thin conceptual ''art'' will not. MICHAEL BOISSON Marfa, Tex., Jan. 2, 2013 The writer is an artist. Mr. Cole confuses the aesthetics and the economics of contemporary art. According to an objective analysis of the current economics of the postwar and contemporary auction markets, such as that published by Beautiful Asset Advisors, we are not experiencing a price ''bubble'' in this collecting category. This market is still ''recovering'' from the true bubble that existed between 2007 and the end of the third quarter of 2008, which burst along with the rest of the economy. There have been and always will be a vast mix of reasons a particular work or artist attracts huge sums, from gallery owners price supporting their own artists, to wealthy collectors with a substantial collection ''protecting'' the overall value of their holdings, to investment syndicates engaging in pure speculation. I am not willing to sit in judgment of people's reasons for buying a particular work or the price they chose to pay for it. I am confident that the vast majority of art collectors buy what they like and what ''speaks'' to them. I am content to let Mr. Cole and art critics express their own tastes and to let art buyers pay whatever price they deem appropriate. The fact that someone pays $30 million for a painting is not going to influence my opinion of the artist or his work. LEWIS N. BROWN Miami, Jan. 2, 2013 I would like to put forward the notion that Andy Warhol be removed from his list of artists that he views as flashes in the pan. Quite simply, Warhol changed the visual vocabulary of the United States, and by extension the world, through his radical departure from preconceived notions of what art is, how it functions, and, yes, ultimately how it is sold, traded and collected. By celebrating the mundane and by doing so across all media, Warhol laid the foundations for (love them or hate them) contemporary visual culture, reality TV and nearly all contemporary art production today. Not bad for a kid from a poor family here in Pittsburgh, where an entire museum dedicated to him resides. Oh, and one last thing: Warhol based nearly everything he did on art history and the great artists who came before him. He rethought and refigured the overarching tenets of art history to quite literally change the way we understand the world around us, and for that he is well embedded in the annals of art history, where he so firmly belongs. ERIC SHINER Director, The Andy Warhol Museum Pittsburgh, Jan. 2, 2013 Mr. Cole is right that the prices for much of contemporary art have risen dramatically in recent years, and that this increase is not necessarily related to our perception of the quality of the works sold. However, two points should be kept in mind. First, ''quality'' is a highly fluid and subjective term; the consensus of informed opinion changes from year to year and from country to country, and for that matter, within a single individual over time. That volatility is particularly true for the art of one's own time, which by definition changes day by day. And what is the definition of ''informed''? Many ''uninformed'' people have better records as connoisseurs, choosing ''good'' works of art, than those of us who have Ph.D.'s in art history. Second, quality and price have never been completely in sync, especially (but not exclusively) when it comes to contemporary art. If they were, Rembrandt's etchings would bring higher prices than Damien Hirst's sharks and LeRoy Neiman's paintings. The prices we are talking about are what the works go for on the art market, through dealers or at auction. The art market is not an ideal, academic exercise; it's a business. People buy and sell works of art for a profit. ''Quality,'' ''art historical importance'' and recognizable names are all factors in determining price, but hardly the only ones. Other, fairly objective criteria have always included such issues as authenticity, rarity, condition, subject, provenance, medium (etchings versus paintings) and even size. If, in fact, some works of art are overpriced, others are probably underpriced. What an opportunity for people who love art for itself to find a few bargains! Ithaca, N.Y., Jan.3, 2013 The writer is an art historian and former director of three museums, including, most recently, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University. The Writer Responds Professor Hales argues that big projects -- regardless of how bad the results are -- entail considerable expense, so we shouldn't complain about the price tag. Members of Congress should use this kind of argument whenever they vote themselves a raise. In any case, the artists I mentioned have generally avoided pharaonic works, focusing instead on mass-produced kitsch. Yes, Mr. Boyer, of course past ages produced lousy artists. But these days, as Mr. Waits's perceptive letter indicates, a select group of the lousy artists have complex, well-financed infrastructures that prop up the market for their work. And speaking of well-financed infrastructures, we have a letter from Christie's, which benefits enormously from the exalted reputations of inferior artists. With strategic donations, rich collectors and dealers gain influence in major art museums. Whose works do you suppose they encourage those museums to purchase and exhibit? Whose works do they donate, sometimes retaining a life interest, for huge tax deductions calculated according to market prices, however ridiculous those prices might be? So while only the few can afford to actually hang such pictures on their walls, the rest of us taxpayers get to help pay for them. Who said the art market wasn't democratic?

(Harlequin Mira)For the last week, hackers have - once again - attacked the online banking sites of several American banks. The attacks appear to be the second stage of a campaign that began in September, when a hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters took credit for a series of attacks on the Web sites of Bank of America, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC that caused intermittent delays. The group said it had attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad and pledged to continue its campaign until the video was removed from the Internet. They called the campaign Operation Ababil, a Koran reference to the swallows Allah sent to attack an army of elephants dispatched by the King of Yemen to attack Mecca in 571 A.D. In an online post on Tuesday, the group said that it had resumed Operation Ababil and that, over the last several weeks, it had focused on nine banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, BB&T, Suntrust and Regions Financial. "Our aim of this operation is removal of that insulting and absurd film," the hackers wrote in an online post. Of the nine banks, representatives of PNC, BB&T and Citigroup confirmed that their online banking sites had experienced intermittent disruptions because of a high volume of Web traffic, but they said that bank accounts and customer information had not been affected. Though they were not mentioned in the group's online hit list, Capital One and Fifth Third Bank also experienced brief disruptions. Customers at Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan did not appear to have had any trouble reaching their accounts. In an e-mail to customers, PNC said it had experienced "an unusually high volume of traffic" to its site. "This volume of traffic is consistent with threatened cyberattacks on the U.S. banking system and is designed to cause access delays for legitimate Internet customers," the statement said. Debra DeCourcy, a spokeswoman for Fifth Third Bank, said that from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, Fifth Third also had a high volume of traffic to its site. "We believe it was a denial of service attack designed to disrupt access to our site," Ms. DeCourcy said. "This was an access issue, not a security issue: No customer information or data was compromised." In a denial of service attack, hackers bombard a site with traffic until it collapses under the load. Though banks take great pains to absorb large volumes of traffic, many experienced unprecedented levels. Typically such attacks are deployed through a Web application, in which hackers recruit volunteers to click on a link that sends signals from their computers to a victim's site, or through botnets, networks of infected computers and devices that do hackers' work for them. But security researchers who studied the attacks on banking sites last fall said hackers had used a new weapon: data centers. Researchers at Radware who investigated the attacks for several banks found that the traffic was coming from data centers around the world that had been infected with a sophisticated form of malware that was designed to evade detection by antivirus solutions. The attackers used those infected servers to simultaneously fire traffic at each banking site until it slowed or collapsed. By infecting data centers instead of computers, attackers obtained the horsepower to mount an enormous denial of service attack. Jenny Shearer, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment on the source of the attacks on Friday. In an online post, hackers said the attacks had not been sponsored by a country. Government and intelligence officials have blamed Iran for the fall attacks and for a destructive cyberattack on computers at Saudi Aramco in August, though they have not presented any evidence to back up their claims. Tracing cyberattacks back to one particular country is difficult, security experts say, because traffic can be routed through different Internet addresses to mask their true origin. Security researchers still do not know how the data centers used in the first wave of attacks were infected in the first place, how widespread the infection rate was and - perhaps most troubling - whether the servers could be used to damage other sensitive targets in the future. On Tuesday, the hackers said they had no intention of halting their campaign. "Officials of American banks must expect our massive attacks," they wrote. "From now on, none of the U.S. banks will be safe." This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.1913 Bobsleigh Race at Swiss Resort ENGELBERG -- The first of the bobsleigh races was run off yesterday [Jan. 2] in record time. The contest attracted numerous spectators and was very successful. Lieutenant G. A. Anstay was the winner. He steered his ''bob'' in a steady but very fast style. His brother, Mr. C. Anstay, was at the brake, and they worked well together, showing excellent team combination. Miss Taylor, from Australia, was the only woman on the bobsleigh. Though very young, she is proving herself one of the best and keenest of sportswomen, having already won two prizes in lugeing. Mr. H. V. Gould finished second in the race. 1938 President Addresses Labor Issue WASHINGTON -- President Roosevelt, in a press conference today [Jan. 4], suggested that a series of conferences between government and business might develop, a program for preventing overproduction, establishing intelligent purchasing power and assisting the creation of necessary inventories. He said it would be similar in purpose to the National Recovery Administration, but emphasized that he did not intend to establish an N.R.A., or price-fixing in any form. He said he doubted whether such a procedure as he outlined would be legal under the present anti-trust laws, but said he thought the laws should be revised. 1963 De Gaulle Meets U.S. Envoy PARIS -- United States Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen today [Jan. 4] discussed the Anglo-American Nassau pact and the American offer of Polaris missiles to France with President Charles de Gaulle. Mr. Bohlen told reporters afterward that the 45-minute talk had been ''friendly and cordial.'' But he declined to go into detail. An Embassy source described the meeting as an ''exchange of ideas.'' The offer to both France and Britain is to supply them with missiles without warheads provided the units using them are placed under North Atlantic Treaty Organization control except in instances of supreme national interest.The Federal Trade Commission's antitrust investigation of Google focused mainly on the company's lucrative search business, while its inquiry into the tech giant's handling of patents seemed an afterthought. Yet even as Google made only a few voluntary promises on search, it agreed to a legal settlement on patents that Jon Leibowitz, the commission chairman, called a ''landmark enforcement action'' that applies to huge high-tech markets like smartphones and tablet computers. The commission action by no means spells the end of the smartphone patent wars, a global conflict in which major corporations including Apple, Samsung and Google have spent billions amassing patent portfolios and then suing and countersuing one another in courts around the world. But legal experts say Google's settlement with the F.T.C. signals progress in clarifying the rules of engagement in high-tech patent battles, and thus could ease them. ''The agreement represents a significant stride forward in reducing the confusion and uncertainty that currently surrounds how these patents can be used,'' said Colleen Chien, a patent expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law. The commission's settlement with Google, announced on Thursday, focused on patents covering communications and data transmission technologies that are crucial for the basic operation of smartphones and tablets -- what are known as standard-essential patents. (There are many other patents in mobile devices, covering physical design and software features.) The legal gamesmanship of the epic smartphone patent battles, according to economists and technology experts, consumes time and investment that could be better used to develop new products. In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Leibowitz pointed to those concerns. ''Today's commission action,'' he said, ''will also relieve companies of some of the costly and inefficient burden of hoarding patents for purely defensive purposes, savings that we hope can be invested in job-creating research and development.'' Under the settlement, Google agreed to license its standard-essential patents to other companies on ''fair and reasonable'' terms. It also agreed not to seek court injunctions to halt the shipment of smartphones, tablets and other devices that use its standard patents. The issue arose from Google's $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, announced in 2011 and completed last year. Google acquired Motorola partly to defend itself and the smartphone makers that use its Android software after rivals had already loaded up on patents. With the acquisition, Google picked up 17,000 patents, including many relating to wireless devices that Motorola, a pioneer in the wireless phone business, had pledged to license on reasonable terms. Those commitments were made to technology standards organizations, intended to assure that basic technical innovations are widely available, stimulating growth in the industry. Over the years, according to Mr. Leibowitz, companies took Motorola at its word and developed products assuming they could routinely license Motorola's patents. But Motorola later refused to license its standard-essential patents and sought court injunctions to stop shipment of rival products. ''After Google purchased Motorola,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, ''it continued these same abusive practices.'' In recent months, the F.T.C. has issued position papers and filed friend-of-the-court briefs, opposing the motions for injunctions using standard patents. The Justice Department and European regulators have echoed the commission's stance. ''Regulators around the world have become increasingly sensitive to just how important technical standards and standards-setting bodies are to the modern system of economic innovation,'' said Josh Lerner, an economist at Harvard Business School. The threat of court injunctions to stop shipment of products, economists say, is the factor that drives up the cost of patent wars. Because an injunction could be devastating, companies will pay dearly to remove that risk, settling with a plaintiff or spending on patents to build a defensive arsenal. Some courts have recently resisted granting injunctions based on standard patents. Google's settlement with the F.T.C., said Carl Shapiro, a former chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division, ''helps solidify the move to stop injunctions in standard-essential patent cases, which is great.'' Dr. Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that courts had also been more hesitant recently to grant injunctions in cases that did not involve standard patents. In suits involving smartphones and tablets -- amalgams of hardware, software and telecommunications technologies covered by many thousands of patents -- judges are sometimes less likely to halt the shipment of a device based on a few infringing patents. Last month, for example, Lucy Koh, a Federal District Court judge in San Jose, Calif., denied Apple's motion for an injunction against Samsung products. In August, a jury in that court found that Samsung products infringed on a handful of Apple design and software patents, and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. Judge Koh declined to grant Apple's motion for injunction, essentially saying that Apple's claim was outweighed by the public interest in keeping Samsung shipments flowing. Apple is appealing the ruling. ''The courts seem to be moving toward taking a dimmer view of injunctions generally,'' Dr. Shapiro said. ''That's a big deal.''''Don't Be Evil,'' the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, proclaimed in their 2004 ''Owner's Manual'' for prospective investors in the company. Despite widespread cynicism, criticism and even mockery, the company has never backed down on this core premise, reiterating in its most recent list of the ''things we know to be true'' that ''you can make money without doing evil.'' Yet the company has been dogged for years by widespread allegations that it violates its own pledge by manipulating the search results that remain the core of the company and the primary source of its enormous profits. Google insists that its results have always been ''unbiased and objective'' and that they are ''the best we know how to produce.'' But for competitive reasons, it never disclosed the secret algorithms that produce those results, so no one outside the company knew for sure. A growing chorus of complaints from companies like Expedia, Yelp and, especially, Microsoft that Google manipulates the results to favor its interests at the expense of competitors led both the United States government and the European Union to take up the issue. On Thursday, after nearly two years of investigation, the Federal Trade Commission rendered a verdict: Google isn't evil. It may have been ''aggressive,'' as the commission delicately put it. But ''regarding the specific allegations that the company biased its search results to hurt competition, the evidence collected to date did not justify legal action by the commission,'' said Beth Wilkinson, outside counsel to the F.T.C. ''The F.T.C.'s mission is to protect competition, and not individual competitors.'' The decision is ''a huge victory for Google,'' Randal Picker, a professor of commercial law at the University of Chicago Law School and a specialist in antitrust and intellectual property, told me just after this week's decision. It's also a vindication of the integrity of Google's search results and the company's credibility. ''There's never been any evidence that consumers were harmed by Google's practices, and no evidence that Google ever engaged in any manipulation that violates antitrust law,'' said Eric Goldman, a professor of law and director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law. The decision is also likely to set standards for competition on the Internet for years to come. It's a blow to competitors like Microsoft, which has been stirring up opposition to Google for years, not to mention newer rivals like Facebook, Apple and Amazon. ''The gloves will be off,'' Professor Picker predicted. ''The F.T.C. has indicated it's going to be taking a very cautious approach toward regulating competition on the Internet.'' But will the decision ultimately prove to be good for consumers? The F.T.C. did secure some concessions from Google regarding patent licensing and advertiser options. But to call those a slap on the wrist would be an overstatement. What mattered most to both Google users and competitors was Google's search practices, which had never been put under the regulatory microscope to such a degree and which the F.T.C. left untouched. Google's search results have evolved significantly from its early, simpler days. When I searched for ''flight JFK to LAX'' this week, I got three categories of results: paid ads at the top and on the right; a Google-produced chart comparing flight options with the disclaimer, which you need to click on, that ''Google may be compensated by these providers''; and so-called organic results below that. The first two organic results were entries for Expedia, a rival to Google's travel site. But given the layout and size of my screen, none of the organic results were visible unless I scrolled down. However clearly labeled, the prominence of Google's own travel results gives pause to some antitrust experts. ''Location is important,'' Professor Picker said. ''No one thinks otherwise. Years ago, it was important for airlines' reservations systems to be on the first screen. But I'm not sure this is an antitrust problem.'' Still, the issue is likely to be a focus of the European Union's investigation of Google, and it will probably be less sympathetic to unbridled competition on the Internet than the American authorities, and more inclined to protect competitors. My flight search results seem to bear out the finding that Google doesn't manipulate organic results, and the paid ads were clearly labeled. But what about the chart Google put together, the result of its 2011 acquisition of the travel site ITA Software? It's certainly useful to anyone planning to book a flight, and it's easy to use. It's information I'd like to see as a consumer. But does it eliminate the need to go to Expedia, leveraging Google's dominant position in search to harm a competitor? And given that the results in the box may reflect payments to Google, is the information objective? Or try some shopping options, like ''Nike shoes.'' On the top right -- the first thing my eyes hit upon -- was a box put together by Google, with pictures of Nike shoes and prices from various retailers. The organic results featured several Nike entries and various shoe retailers, but no comparison shopping sites, at least not on the first page. Google discloses that the retailers in the box, too, may have made payments to Google. It's easy to imagine how frustrating this is to competitors like Nextag, a comparison shopping site that's been one of the loudest complainers about Google. And for Microsoft, the ruling must be especially painful. It faced monopolization charges and years of costly, distracting litigation after it tied its Internet Explorer browser to its dominant operating system. From Microsoft's point of view, Google is doing the same thing by placing information from its own travel and shopping sites so prominently above organic results. But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested observer. Its rival Bing search engine also displays its own shopping and travel results, albeit not as prominently as Google does. (Microsoft has argued that it's not dominant in search, so that doesn't matter.) And Google maintains that any comparison to Microsoft and the browser wars is outdated and irrelevant. It's easy for consumers to ignore Google's travel and shopping results and go straight to the organic results. There, Expedia is just a click away. No one needs to install anything. ''It's not clear to me that the way users interacted with Microsoft back in the 1990s is analogous to Google search in 2013,'' Professor Goldman said. ''Many of us then did not have a practical choice for a browser. There are still plenty of choices in search.'' Professor Goldman did the same search I did, ''flight JFK to LAX.'' ''I don't like this at all,'' he said of the Google results. ''It's stuffed with paid ads.'' He tried rival Bing. ''It's got news results, which is really bizarre,'' he said. ''But otherwise, it's pretty much the same,'' including a box from the Bing travel site. ''I'd probably just go directly to United.com., then Orbitz and Google travel.'' More broadly, Professor Goldman noted that Google's dominance in search may no longer be relevant since so many consumers are accessing sites through apps on their smartphones. ''If they like Yelp and Expedia, they just put the app on their phones. That completely bypasses Google,'' he said. Professor Goldman said he believed the F.T.C. reached a ''sensible'' decision. ''If Google does something as well or better as anyone else, what's the harm? We want search engines to make our lives better, and if they do, it's a win for the consumer,'' he said. ''We're getting exactly what we wanted.'' Whether the results Google produces, now bloated with paid ads and Google's own versions of travel, entertainment and shopping sites, are better remains for consumers to judge, and they can always seek alternatives. But even Professor Goldman conceded that if Google pushed its organic results ever further down the page, and managed to put rivals like Yelp and Expedia out of business, consumers might suffer. Competitors ''help keep Google honest,'' he said. ''Google might get fat and happy.''8 P.M. (HBO) THE THREE STOOGES (2012) Will Sasso stars as Curly, Sean Hayes is Larry, and Chris Diamantopoulos is Moe (pictured above, from left) in this fictionalized origin story for the mostly lovable fools, and paean to the art of the eye poke, from Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Divided into ''episodes,'' the tale follows the Stooges from infancy -- when they're tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David) -- to adulthood, when they're forced to try to save the orphanage in which they were reared from the faltering economy and other calamities. Jane Lynch plays the Mother Superior who sends them out into the world, where they meet a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) and her lover (Craig Bierko); the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa); and some of the cast of ''Jersey Shore.'' ''The three leads in 'The Three Stooges' play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''Much of the pleasure in 'The Three Stooges' comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming. They are, as the Farrellys understand, testaments to human resilience, one slap and tickle at a time.''

Ms. Streep plays the title character with a perfectionism that ''has rarely seemed so apt,'' A. O.

''So what does Steve say?,'' Rachel Saltz wrote in The Times. ''Mostly things you've heard before: Men need to be the providers (it's in their DNA); men don't like the words 'we need to talk,' etc. A running joke is that Mr. Harvey has thrown men under the bus by giving away their secrets.

As they escape the confines of the Tokyo Hyatt, something like love ensues. Mr. Murray ''supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. ''The corollary of this is that Ms. Coppola's direction is so breezily assured in its awareness of loneliness that the film could potentially be dismissed as self-consciously moody rather than registering as a mood piece. But it's bound to be recognized as a movie worthy of the kind of Oscar attention occasionally given to films that challenge audiences subtly.''

Jones, a federal judge and a former prosecutor, is stepping down from the bench to join the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder. In an interview, Ms. Jones, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said that her last day as judge was Friday and that she would start at Zuckerman Spaeder later this month. "I've been in public service for more than 40 years, the last 17 on the bench," Judge Jones said. "I'm ready to try something new." Judge Jones, 65, has never worked in a law firm, not even during a summer internship. A graduate of Temple University's law school, she spent the first half of her career as a prosecutor in three offices - the Justice Department's organized crime strike force, the United States attorney's office in the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan district attorney's office. President Bill Clinton, acting on the recommendation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, nominated her for a judgeship in 1995. She presided over a wide range of cases, including the 2005 trial of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and the 1997 trial of Autumn Jackson, a woman who tried to extort millions of dollars from the entertainer Bill Cosby. Both resulted in convictions. Judge Jones also heard the Justice Department's lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard, finding that the companies had violated antitrust laws. While some defense lawyers viewed the former prosecutor as pro-government, many more said that she had been evenhanded in her rulings. In November, she meted out relatively lenient sentences to three men from Mali who had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges that involved a conspiracy supporting Al Qaeda. Justifying her sentence, she noted that the men had been driven by financial motives and difficult family circumstances rather than ideology. "Barbara is smart, dedicated and understands both the letter and objectives of the law," said Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney in Manhattan and now a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton. "She also understands people and brings real humanity to everything she does." In Zuckerman Spaeder, Ms. Jones joins a law firm that has expanded its Manhattan office over the last year. A litigation boutique with headquarters in Washington, the firm recently hired three prominent lawyers for its New York presence: Steven M. Cohen, a former top aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo; Andrew E. Tomback, a former partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy; and Paul Shechtman, a criminal defense lawyer who, as a young prosecutor, was supervised by Ms. Jones. The firm has about 90 lawyers and is known for its criminal defense work. William W. Taylor III, a partner in the firm's Washington office, was part of the team that successfully defended Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, against charges that he had sexually assaulted a hotel maid. "Being able to attract a lawyer like Judge Jones validates what we have been doing since we relaunched the New York office," Mr. Cohen said. On the bench, Judge Jones was known for her efficiency, low-key manner and wry sense of humor. She is also a very popular figure around the federal courthouse, partly because of the blowout holiday party that she throws almost every year for the entire building. Judge Jones hosted her final party two weeks ago, where she could be seen dancing amid the security guards and court reporters and wearing a Santa hat emblazoned with the logo of her beloved New York Yankees. "I've always been awed by the power and responsibility that comes with being a judge and don't expect to have that ever again," Ms. Jones said. "But I've never been a private citizen and am excited to go out into the world." This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.DETROIT -- Automakers on Thursday reported their strongest sales year since 2007, posting solid December results in the United States and promising more growth in 2013. Sales of new cars and trucks increased 9 percent in December, a gain that put total sales for 2012 at about 14.5 million vehicles -- the industry's best performance in five years, according to the research firm Autodata. That represents a 13 percent increase over 2011, and raises expectations that demand will continue to rise as more Americans need to replace their aging vehicles with new models. Auto executives forecast that the United States market would grow to at least 15.5 million this year and possibly higher, if housing starts and other economic factors continue to improve. ''For the industry, 2012 was mission accomplished,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research site TrueCar.com. ''Companies are hitting their sales goals, and they are doing it with fewer incentives.'' Much of the growth has been concentrated in the comebacks of Toyota and Honda from supply chain disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan two years ago. And while automakers like Chrysler and Volkswagen posted hefty increases throughout the year, the two biggest American companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, lagged the overall gains. December was a microcosm of the year's results, as G.M. and Ford on Thursday reported smaller sales increases than those of their chief domestic, European and Asian rivals. G.M. said sales in December increased 4.9 percent, compared with the same month a year ago, primarily because of new products like the Cadillac ATS sedan and higher incentives on its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. The company had been losing ground in the high-profit pickup segment until it added discounts to the Silverado, which posted a 6.1 percent sales increase in December, and the Sierra, which was up 13.4 percent. For the year, G.M. sold 2.59 million vehicles, an increase of 3.7 percent from 2011. G.M.'s head of United States sales, Kurt McNeil, said the company expected significant growth to about 15.5 million vehicles industrywide this year. He noted that Tuesday's pact on the fiscal crisis in Washington removed potential concerns for consumers shopping for new vehicles. ''We are especially pleased that the politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington were able to compromise,'' Mr. McNeil said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday. ''The short-term crisis has passed.'' Ford reported a slight sales increase of 1.6 percent in December, as safety recalls for its new Escape S.U.V. and Fusion sedan depressed its overall results. Ford said that sales of the Fusion dropped 10.8 percent during the month, and Escape sales slid 21.3 percent. The company has been plagued with multiple recalls on engines and other parts on the new vehicles, which are usually among its strongest sellers. The drop-off was mitigated by strong results for Ford's two smallest cars, the Focus, which increased in sales by 58.3 percent, and the Fiesta, which was up by 52.8 percent. For all of 2012, Ford's United States sales increased 4.7 percent, to 2.24 million vehicles. Ken Czubay, head of Ford's United States sales and marketing, said the company's small-car sales were its best in more than a decade. Ford predicted that industry sales could possibly reach 16 million vehicles in 2013, as more consumers trade in older models and buy new, more fuel-efficient ones. That peak hasn't been reached since sales of 16.1 million in 2007. Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit companies, was the star performer in December, with a 10.4 percent increase. The company's new compact car, the Dodge Dart, gained traction with sales of 6,100 -- its highest monthly total since it was introduced last summer. Much of Chrysler's lineup -- ranging from Jeep S.U.V.'s to the tiny Fiat 500 -- posted sales records for the month of December. For the year, Chrysler said it sold 1.65 million vehicles, a 20.6 percent increase from 2011. Toyota reported a 9 percent sales gain in December, which was one of the weaker months in its turnaround in 2012. The company said it sold 2.08 million vehicles in the United States for the full year, which was a 26.6 percent gain over 2011. Its three top-selling vehicles -- the Corolla compact car, Camry sedan and Prius gas-electric hybrid -- accounted for nearly half of its overall sales for the year. Analysts said Toyota appeared poised to outperform the overall market this year as well. ''Fresh products like the all-new RAV4 S.U.V. should help keep the momentum going,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. Honda ended the year on a high note, reporting a 26.2 percent jump in sales in December in the United States. Its bellwether cars, the Accord and Civic, led the way, each with increases of more than 60 percent. For the year, Honda said it sold 1.14 million vehicles, a 24 percent gain from 2011. Other automakers had mixed results. Nissan said its December sales dropped 1.6 percent, but the company ended 2012 with a 9.5 percent gain for the year. Volkswagen closed the year with another banner month. The German automaker reported a 29.9 percent gain for December and a 30.6 percent increase for the full year.For Barnes & Noble, the digital future is not what it used to be. After a year spent signaling its commitment to build its business through its Nook division, Barnes & Noble on Thursday announced disappointing holiday sales figures, with steep declines that underscored the challenge it faces in transforming from its traditional retail format. Retail sales from the company's bookstores and its Web site, BN.com, decreased 10.9 percent from the comparable nine-week holiday period a year earlier, to $1.2 billion, the company reported. More worrisome for the long-term future of the company, sales in the Nook unit that includes e-readers, tablets, digital content and accessories decreased 12.6 percent over the same period, to $311 million. "They are not selling the devices, they are not selling books and traffic is down," said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of Idea Logical, a consultant to publishers. "I'm looking for an optimistic sign and not seeing one. It is concerning." The results, covering a period that ended Dec. 29, are a sobering development for the nation's largest bookstore chain. The declines occurred during what is supposed to be peak buying season. And the Nook unit's sagging fortunes came despite a 13 percent increase in sales of digital content, suggesting that it is the tepid demand for Nook devices that is dragging down the unit's performance. Over all, the numbers underscore the difficult challenge the company faces in an increasingly competitive e-reading market. Barnes & Noble has invested heavily in developing a tablet that can compete with offerings from media giants like Google, Apple and Amazon.com. Last April, in announcing a $300 million investment in Nook by Microsoft, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble's chief executive, William J. Lynch, said the company wanted "to solidify our position as a leader in the exploding market for digital content in the consumer and education segments." A few months after that, the bookseller began breaking out the financial results of the Nook division, In October it completed its strategic partnership with Microsoft by creating Nook Media, a subsidiary and a signal that it was ready to ride its digital business into the future. But while Barnes & Noble's most recent Nooks have won critical praise, they have failed to gain significant traction with consumers. Other companies do not break out sales of their digital tablets, but Amazon has been saying sales of its Kindle Fire were strong. Analysts say Apple's iPads also appear to be doing well. "The problem is not whether or not the Nook is good," said James L. McQuivey, a media analyst for Forrester Research. "What matters is whether you are locked into a Kindle library or an iTunes library or a Nook library. In the end, who holds the content that you value?" For an increasing number of consumers, he said, the answer is not Barnes & Noble. Though the company's stock was down only slightly - falling 2 percent to $14.22 - the reaction in the financial world was unsparing. Analysts stopped short of saying that this was a do-or-die moment for the Nook Media division, but they acknowledged that options for a strong digital future were narrowing. In a note to clients, S&P Capital IQ said, "We think this portends greater market share losses for the Nook over the medium term" and downgraded its recommendation on Barnes & Noble stock from hold to sell. Barclays said in a note that the Nook's precipitous decline was "quite concerning" and "below even our modest expectations." The declining retail numbers were also troubling when viewed in the context of a rise in sales among independent booksellers. The American Booksellers Association, which has not yet released official holiday sales, estimated Thursday that its members' sales would be up about 8 percent over last year. Barnes & Noble executives were not available Thursday to discuss the sales numbers. But a statement from Mr. Lynch indicated that the company was searching for a solution. "Nook device sales got off to a good start over the Black Friday period, but then fell short of expectations for the balance of holiday," Mr. Lynch said. "We are examining the root cause of the December shortfall in sales, and will adjust our strategies accordingly going forward." The most intriguing, and troublesome, question is whether the company can stay in the digital device business at all over the long run. Nook has been expensive to develop and market and the company does not have the hefty financial resources of its competitors. Other options are strategic partnerships. Microsoft's investment last spring was seen at the time as a way to promote Nook through a powerful partner. But sales of the Windows 8 operating system have been disappointing and the Nook has been featured as little more than an app among hundreds on the Windows 8 platform. "It is going to prove to be a missed opportunity," said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester. Last month, Barnes & Noble announced that Pearson, the British education and publishing conglomerate, was taking a 5 percent stake in Nook for $89.5 million. Analysts said that cash investment was welcome and the partnership with Pearson, a major publisher of educational textbooks, might herald a strategy to move toward dominating an education niche market. Still, that would be a significantly smaller business. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided not to file insider trading charges against David L. Sokol, a onetime top lieutenant at Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Sokol's lawyer said Thursday. Mr. Sokol came under scrutiny in 2011 after abruptly resigning as chairman of Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings, one of the many holdings of the investment conglomerate run by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett. At the time, Berkshire revealed that Mr. Sokol bought shares in Lubrizol, a maker of lubricants that he wanted Mr. Buffett to buy. Mr. Sokol bought the shares about two months before Berkshire announced a $9 billion acquisition of the company. After the deal was announced, the value of his Lubrizol stake rose by $3 million. But Mr. Sokol's lawyer, Barry Wm. Levine, said that the S.E.C. informed his client on Thursday that it had completed its inquiry and decided not to pursue a civil enforcement action. Mr. Levine said he was happy that his client was "exonerated" and that Mr. Sokol never acted improperly in the trades. "He is the paragon of rectitude," said Mr. Levine, a partner at the law firm Dickstein Shapiro in Washington. John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment on Thursday. The agency typically does not comment when it decides not to pursue action in such cases. The news was first reported online by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Sokol's resignation in 2011 was a rare black eye for Berkshire. A star manager, Mr. Sokol had run several Berkshire subsidiaries, including MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, which sells fractional ownerships of private jets. He was long considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Buffett, 82. Mr. Sokol, now 56, had also become a crucial player in the conglomerate's frequent deal-making, earning the nickname "Mr. Fix-it." He served as a point man for Mr. Buffett on a number of potential transactions, particularly during the financial crisis. His sudden resignation caught Berkshire by surprise. Mr. Buffett said he did not ask for Mr. Sokol's resignation, suggesting at the time that it was a personal decision by Mr. Sokol. Mr. Buffett initially defended his protégé's trading. "Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful," Mr. Buffett said at the time. But additional information surfaced after the Berkshire board investigated Mr. Sokol's trading record. Berkshire directors ultimately accused Mr. Sokol of misleading the company about his personal stake in Lubrizol. Mr. Sokol bought $10 million worth of stock in Lubrizol shortly before bringing the company to Mr. Buffett's attention, according to the board. While Mr. Sokol made a "passing remark" to Mr. Buffett about his trading, the board said that Mr. Sokol did not tell Mr. Buffett that he had bought his stake in Lubrizol after Citigroup bankers had pitched the company as a potential takeover target. He also bought some of the shares, according to the Berkshire directors, after learning that Lubrizol might entertain a takeover offer. "His misleadingly incomplete disclosures to Berkshire Hathaway senior management concerning those purchases violated the duty of candor he owed the company," the board's report in 2011 says. It adds that Mr. Sokol may have failed his fiduciary duty under the law of Delaware, where Berkshire is incorporated. At the time, Mr. Levine said that Mr. Sokol was considering a personal investment in Lubrizol since summer 2010, before meeting with bankers to discuss the company as a potential takeover target. Still, Mr. Buffett said the trades violated company trading policy and called Mr. Sokol's actions "inexplicable and inexcusable." He also provided testimony to S.E.C. investigators. Meanwhile, Berkshire continued to pay Mr. Sokol's legal bills. Last spring, Mr. Buffett claimed those bills reached nearly $200,000 a month. Mr. Buffett could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday night. But later in 2012, S.E.C. lawyers decided that there was insufficient evidence to mount a case against Mr. Sokol. The evidence was circumstantial, S.E.C. officials concluded, and it was unclear whether Mr. Sokol had a true window into the Lubrizol deal-making process. He also had no indication at the time of his stock trades that Mr. Buffett would be interested in acquiring the company. Since resigning from Berkshire, Mr. Sokol has been managing his own portfolio, Mr. Levine said. Pradnya Joshi contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.SAN FRANCISCO -- For 19 months, Google pressed its case with antitrust regulators investigating the company. Working relentlessly behind the scenes, executives made frequent flights to Washington, laying out their legal arguments and shrewdly applying lessons learned from Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle in the 1990s. After regulators had pored over nine million documents, listened to complaints from disgruntled competitors and took sworn testimony from Google executives, the government concluded that the law was on Google's side. At the end of the day, they said, consumers had been largely unharmed. That is why one of the biggest antitrust investigations of an American company in years ended with a slap on the wrist Thursday, when the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of Google's search practices without bringing a complaint. Google voluntarily made two minor concessions. ''The way they managed to escape it is through a barrage of not only political officials but also academics aligned against doing very much in this particular case,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of antitrust law at the University of Iowa who has worked as a paid adviser to Google in the past. ''The first sign of a bad antitrust case is lack of consumer harm, and there just was not any consumer harm emerging in this very long investigation.'' The F.T.C. had put serious effort into its investigation of Google. Jon Leibowitz, the agency's chairman, has long advocated for the commission to flex its muscle as an enforcer of antitrust laws, and the commission had hired high-powered consultants, including Beth A. Wilkinson, an experienced litigator, and Richard J. Gilbert, a well-known economist. Still, Mr. Leibowitz said during a news conference announcing the result of the inquiry, the evidence showed that Google ''doesn't violate American antitrust laws.'' ''The conclusion is clear: Google's services are good for users and good for competition,'' David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a company blog post. The main thrust of the investigation was into how Google's search results had changed since it expanded into new search verticals, like local business listings and comparison shopping. A search for pizza or jeans, for instance, now shows results with photos and maps from Google's own local business service and its shopping product more prominently than links to other Web sites, which has enraged competing sites. But while the F.T.C. said that Google's actions might have hurt individual competitors, over all it found that the search engine helped consumers, as evidenced by Google users' clicking on the products that Google highlighted and competing search engines' adopting similar approaches. Google outlined these kinds of arguments to regulators in many meetings over the last two years, as it has intensified its courtship of Washington, with Google executives at the highest levels, as well as lawyers, lobbyists and engineers appearing in the capital. One of the arguments they made, according to people briefed on the discussions, was that technology is such a fast-moving industry that regulatory burdens would hinder its evolution. Google makes about 500 changes to its search algorithm each year, so results look different now than they did even six months ago. The definition of competition in the tech industry is also different and constantly changing, Google argued. For instance, just recently Amazon and Apple, which used to be in different businesses than Google, have become its competitors. Google's share of the search market has stayed at about two-thirds even though competing search engines are ''just a click away,'' as the company repeatedly argued. That would become the company's mantra to demonstrate that it was not abusing its market power. To underline these arguments, Google spent $13.1 million on lobbying in the first three quarters in 2012, up from $5.9 million in the same period in 2011. And Google's lobbyist in chief, Eric E. Schmidt, the company's executive chairman and former chief executive, has made himself a Washington insider as a close adviser to President Obama. Then there were the lessons of the Microsoft case. ''Google had the Microsoft case as a template,'' said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Google just had to convince the regulators it was sufficiently different from Microsoft.'' One lesson for Google executives was to play nicely with the regulators. Microsoft's executives were known for their uncooperative demeanors during their tangle with the government. But even Mr. Schmidt, known for speaking candidly, was on his best behavior. Google, and its lawyers and hired experts, also argued forcefully that this case was different than the one against Microsoft. For one, they pointed out again, the technology world is so different. At the time of the Microsoft inquiry, its software was the main on-ramp to the Internet. ''Search today is not a bottleneck monopoly for anything,'' said Tim Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who studies competition in computing and has worked as a paid expert for Google recently and for Microsoft in the past. ''That's not the same as everyone who wants to do mass market computing has to go through Google, like back then everyone who wanted to do mass market computing had to go through Microsoft,'' he added. Microsoft, leading a chorus of unsatisfied Google competitors, said Thursday that it was disappointed in the F.T.C.'s decision. In a blog post published Thursday night, Dave Heiner, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, called the decision a ''missed opportunity.'' ''The F.T.C.'s overall resolution of this matter is weak and -- frankly -- unusual,'' Mr. Heiner wrote. ''We are concerned that the F.T.C. may not have obtained adequate relief even on the few subjects that Google has agreed to address.'' Mr. Heiner added that Microsoft remained hopeful that other antitrust agencies, including those in Europe, would take more forceful action against Google. Harsh criticism of the decision also came from Gary Reback, an experienced Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who represents a collection of Internet companies that complained to the F.T.C. about Google's behavior. ''I've been doing this almost 40 years, been involved in scores of antitrust investigations,'' he said. ''I've never seen anything so incomplete and lacking and even incompetent as what happened here.'' Richard Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of competition, dismissed Mr. Reback's comment as ''silly.'' ''This was a very thorough, very professional investigation performed by very diligent and dedicated staff,'' he said. Regulators had anticipated criticism from Google's rivals and tried to answer the complaints in their news conference. ''Some believe the commission should have done more in this case, perhaps because they are locked in a hand in hand combat with Google around the world,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. But, he said, ''We really do follow the facts where they lead.'' He added, ''The focus of our law is on protecting competition, not competitors.'' Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia who was a senior adviser to the F.T.C. until last summer, said the outcome of the Google case reflected a change in thinking about antitrust enforcement. ''It used to be like the way we dealt with the mob,'' said Mr. Wu, who was involved in the agency's Google inquiry but who emphasized that he was not speaking for the F.T.C. ''I don't believe it's the position of antitrust agencies to invent competition where there isn't any,'' he said. ''People like Google better than Bing. Microsoft is trying to do everything it can to change that, but people still seem to prefer Google.'' Still, some veterans of the technology industry said that even though the agency did not find an antitrust violation, it still was sending a message to Google that it was not off the hook for good. ''There's a long track record of government never really going away,'' said David Farber, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief technology for the Federal Communications Commission who testified as a government witness in the Microsoft case. ''They will come back.''Al Gore's Current TV was never popular with viewers, but it was a hit where it counted: with cable and satellite providers. When he co-founded the channel in 2005, Mr. Gore managed to get the channel piped into tens of millions of households - a huge number for an untested network - through a combination of personal lobbying and arm-twisting of industry giants. He called on those skills again after deciding in December to sell Current TV to Al Jazeera for $500 million. To preserve the deal - and the estimated $100 million he would personally receive - he went to some of those same distributors, who were looking for an excuse to drop the low-rated channel, and reminded them that their contracts with Current TV called it a news channel. Were the distributors going to say that an American version of Al Jazeera didn't qualify, possibly invoking ugly stereotypes of the Middle Eastern news giant? "The lawyers for the carriers couldn't find their way around it," said a person briefed on the negotiations who described them on condition of anonymity. Mr. Gore, who lost his last big legal argument - the one in 2000 - succeeded. On Wednesday night, a deal was announced that will bring the Al Jazeera brand into at least 40 million homes in the United States. It will also make Mr. Gore, who is already estimated to be worth more than $100 million, an even richer man. The deal completed an eight-year odyssey for Mr. Gore and for Current TV that confirmed one of the realities of show business: it can be a lot easier to profit from a channel than to come up with must-see TV for viewers. Television executives and observers were surprised by both the big price tag and the decision by Mr. Gore, one of the best-known proponents for action to combat global warming, to sell to a Middle Eastern monarchy built with oil wealth. The headline on a FoxNews.com op-ed on Thursday was "Global warming guru Al Gore becomes rich hypocrite with sale of Current TV to Qatar, Inc." Several analysts said that Al Jazeera overpaid for Current. "The deep-pocketed Qatari royal family backing Al Jazeera handily outbid any other bidder's rational bid," the research firm PrivCo said in a note to clients. Mr. Gore did not directly respond to those lines of criticism on Thursday. But in an e-mail message he wrote of his reason for divesting: "I am incredibly proud of what Current has been able to accomplish. But broadcast media is a business, and being an independent content producer in a time of increasing consolidation is a challenge." Current was never a full-time job for Mr. Gore. He is a co-founder of Generation Investment Management, an investment partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, an adviser to Google and a board member at Apple. He also is the chairman of a nonprofit called the Climate Reality Project. He rarely appeared on camera on Current. Still, as its chairman, he was seen as crucial to the business. "When it came to distribution issues, he was always available to make that final call. He was always the closer," said a Current TV executive, who like others interviewed insisted on anonymity to protect business relationships. Current was born out of Newsworld International, a niche channel that Mr. Gore and his business partners bought in 2004 for an undisclosed sum. Newsworld's biggest distributor at the time was DirecTV, which sold television service to 20 million homes, and the man about to become the controlling shareholder of DirecTV was none other than Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation. In a meeting in New York, Mr. Gore leaned on Mr. Murdoch for an extended contract with a lucrative per-subscriber fee. Mr. Gore asserted that DirecTV should carry a "diverse set of news sources." The resulting contract guaranteed Current roughly 10 cents per subscriber per month and helped Mr. Gore secure the financing he needed to acquire Newsworld. It also laid the groundwork for similar extensions with smaller distributors. That's why Current, despite having one of the puniest audiences of any widely distributed cable channel, was able to post annual revenue of about $100 million. Mr. Gore took a role in running Current, handpicking some hosts for the channel, including Keith Olbermann and Jennifer Granholm in 2011 and Mr. Olbermann's replacement, Eliot Spitzer, in 2012. (Ms. Granholm recalled the day when "Al Gore called out of the blue and said, 'We've got this network, and this is a really important election. We want to do a political show about the election - would you be interested in helping?'") But none of the hosts could attract an audience large enough to satisfy distributors, particularly Time Warner Cable, which had been warning for over a year that it might drop Current from its lineup. Mr. Gore, frustrated by the low ratings, told associates he felt he was having more impact through his AlGore.com blog and through volunteer training than through Current. Last summer Mr. Gore started anchoring election coverage himself, but by then he and his co-founder Joel Hyatt were determined to cash out. In the fall, their bankers invited a phalanx of major media companies, including The New York Times Company, to look at Current's books and took calls from interested parties, including Glenn Beck's online network TheBlaze, which like Al Jazeera has been seeking to make deals with distributors. The prospect of Mr. Gore's doing business with Mr. Beck, a staunch conservative, was even more unlikely than Mr. Gore and Al Jazeera. Mr. Beck said on his radio show Thursday that his company's interest was rebuffed "within 15 minutes." "We were not allowed to the table," he said. "He didn't sell to the highest bidder. He looked for, Who do I ideologically align with?" Mr. Beck's producer Stu Burguiere added, "The guy who was vice president of the United States and was 537 votes away from being president during 9/11 is ideologically aligned, by his own definition, with the network that Osama bin Laden went to every time he wanted to get a message out." Mr. Gore, who will have an unpaid seat on the board of the new Al Jazeera channel, does not see it that way. Al Jazeera, he said, is one of the most popular media companies in the world. "Their global reach is unmatched and their coverage of major events like the Arab Spring is thorough, fair and informative," he said. Patrick Healy contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Many major American retailers were able to recover from a slow start to December shopping, according to monthly sales results reported on Thursday. Despite early indications that the holiday season would be lackluster, the 17 apparel chains tracked by Thomson Reuters reported a 4.5 percent increase for December sales at stores open at least a year, exceeding the 3.3 percent gain analysts had expected. However, Target, the nation's second-biggest retailer after Walmart, said its December sales were flat. Retailers relied on discounts to get that December revenue, which may hurt results when they report fourth-quarter profit. ''Sales came late in the holiday shopping season and, as a result, were at deeper discounts than planned,'' said Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chief executive. He said the company would take further markdowns as it prepares for spring. The stores reporting sales data on Thursday ranged from apparel retailers to department stores, though some large retailers, including J. C. Penney and Saks Fifth Avenue, as well as Walmart, do not report monthly data. Analysts noted a rush of last-minute promotions after slow sales early in the month. ''We've noticed significant promotions at retailers looking to recover preholiday sales, and fewer promotions at retailers we believe have performed well,'' Oliver Chen, a Citigroup analyst, wrote in a research note. With drugstores included in the totals, the rise in December retail sales from a year ago was 2.3 percent, Thomson Reuters said. Drugstores are dealing with consumers switching to cheaper generic drugs. ShopperTrak, which counts shoppers at the nation's malls, reported that traffic picked up in the final week before Christmas. Still, in December it lowered its sales forecast for November and December to a 2.5 percent gain over last year, down from the 3.3 percent it had estimated previously. Another reading on the holiday season was also tepid. MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which estimates overall consumer spending, said last week that holiday-related sales rose 0.7 percent from the end of October through Christmas Eve, the smallest increase since 2008. Last year, sales were up 2 percent. Most of the department stores reporting results Thursday beat analysts' expectations. At Nordstrom, sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales, were up 8.6 percent, shooting past estimates of 3.4 percent. Kohl's said its same-store sales rose 3.4 percent, above analysts' estimates of 1.2 percent but below Kohl's internal expectations. Macy's same-store sales were about in line with analysts' expectations, at 4.1 percent. Macy's said fourth-quarter earnings would be in a lower range than it had previously announced, at $1.91 to $1.96 a share, down from $1.94 to $1.99 a share. Target, which heavily promotes the holiday season, said its same-store sales were flat compared with last December, while analysts had expected a 0.8 percent gain. Its heavily promoted collection of designer holiday gifts, in partnership with Neiman Marcus, was a disappointment, according to some analysts. The company said that the number of same-store transactions fell compared with last year, but the average amount spent per transaction rose, and that the food, health and beauty, apparel and home categories were up over last year. ''Strong results late in the month did not completely offset softness in the first three weeks,'' Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, said in a statement. The discounter Costco did much better than expected, with a 9 percent same-store sales gain, above the 6.5 percent that analysts had projected. Among apparel stores, the teenage clothing retailer Wet Seal posted a decrease of 9.7 percent and Zumiez posted a decline of 1 percent.10 P.M.

JEFFREY CANE and STEPHANIE STROM NEW CHECKS After spending two years and millions of dollars to temper a regulatory crackdown, the world's biggest banks are now resigned to a wave of new oversight. By New Year's Eve, 65 banks had registered their derivatives businesses with regulators and turned over extensive real-time trading data to outside warehouses, fulfilling a central rule of the Obama administration's financial regulatory overhaul. Late on Wednesday, a warehouse also posted an early batch of data online, shining a rare spotlight on an opaque business that was battered in the 2008 financial crisis. Until now, regulators had little authority and little information to scrutinize the minutiae of derivatives trading, a vast market that totals more than $600 trillion. BEN PROTESS nytimes.com/dealbookMuch as ''green'' became a corporate buzzword in the last few years, connoting an eco-friendly ethos among the business set, ''community'' is now a favorite of the nonprofit world. But if oil companies could be suspected of not being quite as green as their advertising claims, cultural institutions claiming to act on behalf of the community can raise similar alarms. A cynical thought, perhaps, but appropriate when considering ''Go: a community-curated open studio project'' at the Brooklyn Museum. ''Go'' was inspired, according to the publicity materials, by two precedents: ArtPrize, an art competition based in Grand Rapids, Mich., that bills itself as the world's largest and that awards money to artists based on votes by ''the public'' (a separate prize is determined by a jury of ''leading art experts''); and the annual open-studios programs, in which artists invite the public into their work spaces, which have sprouted up somewhat organically in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Dumbo, Gowanus, Red Hook and Bushwick. The Brooklyn Museum took the open-studios model and used it to create a contest in which the award was a spot in ''Go,'' the group exhibition now on view. More than 1,800 artists working all over the borough registered with the museum in May, and for two days in September visitors went out to their studios and then, if they had visited at least five, were eligible to vote for three online. The 10 artists with the largest number of votes were then whittled down to five by Sharon Matt Atkins and Eugenie Tsai, curators at the Brooklyn Museum. And the results? Less than stellar, unfortunately. The winners are an unexciting bunch; in most spheres of contemporary art they would be considered student artists because their work relies so heavily on earlier precedents. It is certainly not on par with the contemporary work the Brooklyn Museum generally exhibits. Yeon Ji-yoo, a young South Korean-born artist, makes collages and sculptures that are very much in the vein of '90s installation art and that recall the uncanny sculptures of Petah Coyne. Gabrielle Watson's figurative paintings feature distorted figures in vibrant hues that are reminiscent of Faith Ringgold, Katherine Bernhardt and the German Expressionists. Adrian Coleman's small, vaguely edgy scenes of Brooklyn are painted in watercolor and feel very similar to a recent raft of photo-based works by watercolorists like Tim Gardner. Oliver Jeffers makes gimmicky paintings, occasionally borrowing the midcentury Situationist technique of détournement -- that is, painting on found paintings in an act of creative disfiguring -- but to much less subversive effect than the master of the form, Asger Jorn. Naomi Safran-Hon, born in Israel, combines inkjet prints on canvas with cement pressed through lace in trompe l'oeil works that recall Valerie Hegarty's haunting painting-sculptures. Video interviews accompanying the works personalize the experience of the art but also underscore that most artists today are very good (sometimes best) at describing what their work is ''about.'' The artists all seem to love Brooklyn, but many visitors to this exhibition will know immediately that ''Go'' has not unearthed any hidden masters of the borough. So what happened? Doing a bit of my own crowdsourcing, I asked a number of artists and visitors who had participated in the open studios for their impressions of the project and found that many had conflicting feelings. On the one hand, the open studios offered an avenue for showing artists' work, and some cases led to visits from members of their communities who hadn't known there were artists working right across the street or in their buildings. But many felt the voting system was flawed: confined to a demographic adept at using communications technology and weighted in favor of artists who were good at self-promotion and could potentially game the system by soliciting votes. ''Go'' is clearly not an accurate representation of the richness of art in Brooklyn and may not reflect the true interests and tastes of the wider community there, either. But it does raise the always interesting question of who should choose what appears in museums and what constitutes ''great'' art. Curators generally assume this role, although history shows that the most qualified experts are often artists themselves. One example is the 1913 Armory Show, which was organized by artists to show the public the breadth and excitement of modern art. As the centennial of this historic show is observed in coming months, it will offer another model and precedent to consider. ''Go: a community-curated open studio project'' continues through Feb. 24 at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.8:43 p.m. | Updated K2 Intelligence, the investigative company started by Jules Kroll and Jeremy Kroll, has acquired the corporate intelligence firm Thacher Associates in a deal that highlights the growing and lucrative business of internal investigations and corporate monitoring. Thacher, which is based in New York, is a leading player in the business of overseeing large-scale construction projects to protect against fraud. The deal, which is expected to be announced on Thursday, underscores the prevalence of private watchdogs not only in the building industry but also across corporate America. Both government regulators and large companies are increasingly looking to independent overseers to monitor businesses for possible wrongdoing. With greater prosecution of financial laws and enhanced government regulation, companies today are increasingly using investigative firms like FTI Consulting and Nardello & Company to supplement their internal compliance and legal programs. In a sign of the business's appeal, the law firm Pepper Hamilton last year acquired the investigative group run by Louis J. Freeh, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "We look at the heightened regulations that companies face every day and see the increased need for independent experts to assure regulators and law enforcement that their requirements will be fulfilled," said Jeremy Kroll, K2's chief executive. Recent cases highlight how the government's increased oversight - especially in financial services - has resulted in the need for corporate baby sitters. The banking giant Standard Chartered, based in London, recently agreed to a demand by New York officials that it hire an outside monitor to ensure compliance with United States money laundering laws. And the Justice Department forced another big bank, HSBC, as part of a deferred prosecution agreement relating to various financial crimes, to hire a corporate monitor for a five-year period. Kroll is a big name in the global investigations industry. In the 1970s, Jules Kroll helped pioneer the business of helping corporations improve their operations by uncovering fraud and other forms of internal corruption. Mr. Kroll expanded the company rapidly, embarking on a series of acquisitions and diversifying into areas like litigation support and data recovery. In 2004, Marsh & McLennan purchased Kroll in an all-cash deal worth $1.9 billion. (Marsh sold Kroll in 2010 to the global security company Altegrity.) Mr. Kroll and his son, Jeremy, left Kroll in 2008. The next year they started K2, which now employs about 120 people. K2's deal with Thacher - the terms of which are not being disclosed - is the first of a number of acquisitions that K2 hopes to make in the near future, Jeremy Kroll said. Mr. Kroll acknowledged that in some ways, K2's planned expansion mirrors the growth strategy executed by Kroll. In acquiring Thacher, K2 adds a profitable niche of "construction integrity monitoring," or providing oversight to big real estate developments. Prominent assignments handled by Thacher include the cleanup of the World Trade Center site, the building of the new Yankee Stadium and the construction of the Bank of America office tower in Midtown Manhattan. Thomas D. Thacher II, the company's chief executive, said that combining with K2 would provide a platform to expand Thacher to new locations. Mr. Thacher's business developed in the 1990s when Mario M. Cuomo, then governor, sought to eliminate graft and corruption in the New York construction industry. A former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, Mr. Thacher served as inspector general of the New York City School Construction Authority before starting his firm. "We've reached a point where we get calls from all over to work on projects, and we don't really have the infrastructure to support that," said Mr. Thacher, who is known as Toby. "By joining forces with K2, we make our services both nationally and internationally." The thinking behind the deal is that what has primarily been a New York-area business has the potential to grow, especially at a time when rebuilding the nation's infrastructure has become a focus, as has updating the electricity grid. "There is a high likelihood of fraud, waste and abuse at large-scale construction projects not just in the tristate area, but all across the country," Jeremy Kroll said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.EATWHATEVER is a two-step breath-freshening product created four years ago by a then-26-year-old Australian expatriate named Jacqui Rosshandler. Starting with $60,000 in capital, contracting out production and working solo from her New York apartment, Ms. Rosshandler and her company, Jacquii L.L.C., managed to grab a promising but tenuous toehold in the billion-dollar breath-freshening industry. THE CHALLENGE Running low on inventory early in 2011 and lacking the money for another production run to fulfill orders to her Web site and restock her Manhattan retail accounts, Ms. Rosshandler feared she would have to shut down her start-up. She had been rejected by bank after bank (some citing her lack of American citizenship). She had decided against asking friends for money -- or her parents, who had already helped at the outset -- and she had come up dry with venture capitalists. As her prospects dimmed, she started interviewing for jobs. THE BACKGROUND Ms. Rosshandler was working at a Manhattan events and interior design company when, on New Year's Day in 2007, she decided that like her father, a successful plastics industry entrepreneur in Australia, she would prefer to work for herself. Her idea: to improve upon a South African product called Odor-Go that she had seen in her native country but nowhere in the United States. Her product would have gel caps to be swallowed, similar to Odor-Go, but it would package them with follow-up mints to be sucked. Plus, her breath-freshening duo would be gluten-free and vegan. ''I wanted to be able to take my own product,'' she said, explaining that most gel caps are made using meat byproducts. She filed to trademark the name Eatwhatever. It was her understanding that the way to vanquish bad breath was to go to the source of the problem, the stomach. Having studied acting and law, not chemistry, Ms. Rosshandler left the product formulation to a contract manufacturer. ''Parsley has been used for generations to freshen breath,'' she said. ''People know, just from everyday life, that freshening the mouth only -- especially after consuming pungent foods -- doesn't get rid of the smell that comes from within the stomach. We found that the combination of concentrated organic peppermint and parsley oils, when dissolved in the stomach, provides this fresh feeling from within. Your breath actually smells good, from deep inside, not just superficially from the mouth.'' She hired a package designer and prominently displayed the tagline: 2 Steps to Kissable Breath. Also on the packaging was a cheeky instructional mash-up of the two operative steps (swallow and suck). She was, after all, seeking a young demographic. ''I had no idea what I was doing,'' said Ms. Rosshandler, laughing. She began her sales efforts in 2008 by walking into the C.O. Bigelow flagship apothecary store in Manhattan and asking, ''Who does the buying here?'' She left with a sale. A month or so after Eatwhatever's debut, a friend in public relations helped her get a mention on DailyCandy's main page. That brought $20,000 worth of orders to her Web site in 12 hours and generated plenty of buzz. With the help of a distributor, Eatwhatever soon cracked New York retail outlets like Ricky's, Joe Coffee and Zitomer, a specialty department store; Ms. Rosshandler even opened retail beachheads in Paris and Sydney. But lacking contracts with mass merchants, sales volume remained low. The company's annual revenue failed to top $40,000 in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Squeezed for cash, Ms. Rosshandler could not pay for marketing or, eventually, even for her next production run. That is when she interviewed for a job selling high-fashion hair accessories. THE OPTIONS And then, in rode her white knight. Or was he? She had networked her way to Arthur T. Shorin, an investor and former chief executive of the Topps Company, a confectionary company known for its baseball trading cards, who promised candy industry expertise and contacts and an immediate infusion of $250,000, with more to come if justified. But Mr. Shorin's nonnegotiable terms were stark. In return, he wanted 75 percent of the enterprise. Ms. Rosshandler would retain 25 percent with the opportunity to earn back another 15 percent should certain benchmarks be met. The offer included a salaried job in Mr. Shorin's New York company, Artuitive, an incubator for start-ups. Friends advised Ms. Rosshandler against the deal, citing the tough terms, even if she were to rebuild her stake to 40 percent. But Mr. Shorin had impressed her in their exploratory meetings, and she asked herself this question: Isn't 25 percent of something better than 100 percent of nothing? WHAT OTHERS SAY Steve Schuster, founder of Schuster Products in Milwaukee, maker of Blitz mints: ''Ms. Rosshandler finds herself in a precarious cash-flow position and -- typical of many start-up entrepreneurs -- may not completely grasp how much money she actually will need to grow her brand to a reasonable level of distribution. Arthur Shorin presents a very shrewd and unique proposition. Basically, he is her lifeline. Mr. Shorin, who made a fortune selling Topps to Michael Eisner's private equity company, has great knowledge of the candy industry. It is imperative for Ms. Rosshandler to move forward with this proposition.'' Josh Kopelman, a partner at First Round Capital, Philadelphia: ''I believe that entrepreneurs, not investors, create great companies. In my experience, if a founder doesn't retain meaningful equity at the seed stage, it greatly reduces their motivation and creates a real misalignment between investor and entrepreneur. I'd encourage Ms. Rosshandler to keep looking for alternatives, including the possibility of raising money from her friends. If she believes the company is going to create value and be successful, then she is actually doing her friends a favor by letting them invest -- assuming she is candid about the extreme level of risk and that they don't invest money they aren't prepared to lose. I'd encourage her to consider tweaking the branding to make it more PG-13 than R-rated, as it might reduce some investor's unease. I know it's hard to turn down money -- especially when a company really needs it.'' Adeo Ressi, founding member of TheFunded and head of The Founder Institute, an early stage business accelerator based in Silicon Valley: ''Ms. Rosshandler should definitely not take this deal. First, she loses complete control of the company, and she can be removed or wiped out of her equity at any moment without notice. Second, the deal is very unusual, so she will never be able to attract other investors again. Third, the round values the operating business under $75,000, around two times revenue. As the terms indicate, she will be an employee of Artuitive, so this deal resembles a generous employment offer rather than a viable investment. This is an angel investment opportunity, and there are the largest number of angel investors in history. On the positive side, if Ms. Rosshandler dedicates four months and meets with a lot of angels, she will raise $500,000 with a seven-figure valuation. On the negative side, she will need to meet with over 150 angels and waste a lot of time pitching to people that will try to take advantage of her, like Arthur Shorin.''

Next week, on the blog and on this page, we will give an update on what Jacqui Rosshandler decided to do.MENDRISIO, Switzerland -- The Swiss like to think their country is to gold what Bordeaux, France, is to wine. Thanks to a dark red merlot produced in the hills surrounding this town in the south of Switzerland, it has both, the real gold and the wine. The real gold is here because four of the world's major gold refineries are on Swiss soil, three of them here in Mendrisio, turning roughly one-third of the world's gold into bars and ingots. The wine is here because over the past several decades this Italian-speaking region has emerged as the largest wine-growing area in Switzerland, and the local merlot has carved a big place in the Swiss wine market. Merlot, said Luigi Zanini Jr., 40, whose father began making wine here in the 1980s after importing Italian wines for decades, ''is king, queen, prince and all of the nobility.'' The company he and his father run, Vinattieri Ticinesi, is now Switzerland's largest winemaker, producing about 500,000 bottles a year. If Mr. Zanini deals in bottled gold, across town, at a sprawling factory with gray concrete walls seven feet high, Erhard Oberli handles the real thing, as the chief executive of Argor-Heraeus, a major refiner processing hundreds of tons of gold every year. Gold refining flourished here, Mr. Oberli said, because of the proximity to Italy, where jewelry is a major industry and labor is cheap. ''Italy, traditionally, was by far the biggest consumer of gold, taking about 800 tons a year, half legally and half illegally,'' he said. The illegal part has largely been cleaned up, but Italy remains a big customer, as do makers of jewelry and watches in Swiss cities like Geneva. The price of gold is now hovering at nearly $1,700 an ounce, compared with less than $300 a dozen years ago. That is not a direct benefit to Mr. Oberli, because his company is a processor of gold, not a trader. But the demand for melted-down gold and fresh ingots from raw gold has soared, so he now has a new $32 million enlargement of his factory to go along with the growth in the number of employees, to 229 from 152 five years ago. Both the gold and the wine are feeding a prosperity here that contrasts sharply with the slump in surrounding regions, most notably northern Italy, long a powerhouse of the European economy. Mendrisio, with its charming old downtown streets ringed by state-of-the-art factories, embedded in steep valleys ringed with vineyards, has long been a magnet for Italians in search of work. In recent years as Europe's borders have grown increasingly porous, and Italy suffers the effects of a debt crisis, the numbers have soared. Every day more than 7,500 Italians clog the roads, making the trek across the border in their Hyundais and Toyotas and the occasional Fiat, coming to jobs in Mendrisio, where the local population is only 11,600. About a decade ago, before Switzerland began joining various European agreements to eliminate border controls, most were unskilled workers in farming or construction, but they are now increasingly skilled people -- engineers, chemists, accountants. Meinrad Perler is the son of a farmer in western, French-speaking Switzerland who went into banking. When that career soured, he turned to his passion, winemaking, settling in Mendrisio in the 1980s. ''It's not the ideal location, too much rain in the wrong seasons, and hot, dry summers,'' he said, steering his sport utility vehicle through steep vineyards. Still, the climate has not prevented Mr. Perler, 75, from building an annual production of 210,000 bottles a year, mostly merlot. Of his 14 full-time employees, 8 are Italians, including his chief oenologist. When he recently advertised for an accountant, 132 letters came in, more than two-thirds from Italians. ''They'll accept a job that is lower than their qualification,'' he said, and for less money. Over at the Zanini winery, of 72 employees, about half are cross-border Italians. ''The tendency is to try and find people from Ticino,'' the region Mendrisio lies in, Mr. Zanini said. ''But maybe there's more desire in Italy.'' At Argor-Heraeus, Mr. Oberli badly needs engineers, chemists and metallurgists, and cannot find them locally. ''In Italy now it's a catastrophe, and given the unemployment, you easily find young, well-trained people,'' he said, turned out by schools like the Technical University in Milan. About two-thirds of his employees are Italians, who drive back to their homes in Italy when the workday is done. Of course there are benefits to employing Italians, like lower pay. The Swiss federal statistical office released figures recently showing that while the average disposable income of a Swiss is roughly $55,000, that of cross-border workers like the Italians is about $48,000. While this gap annoys Swiss employees, who see the foreigners as competitors, employers say the difference is justified. ''Taxes are less in Italy than in Switzerland,'' said Marco Nauer, 49, a metals expert at Argor-Heraeus who is responsible for hiring. The cost of living is lower in Italy as well, so earnings in Swiss francs go further. Behind Mendrisio's neo-Classical town hall, a large parking garage is being built. The dozen or so cars of the construction workers all have Italian plates. ''With the crisis in Italy, there just isn't any work,'' said Davide Grassi, 33, a cement mason from Milan who in July began driving the 40 minutes to work here every day. For some, it is more than money. Last September, Roberta Pellin, who lives in Olgiate Comasco, Italy, a 20-minute drive across the border, opened a little vaulted flower shop along Corso Bello, a pedestrian street in Mendrisio's old town center, after working for 25 years in the flower business in Italy. ''I evaluated the situation in Italy and decided it's far easier in Switzerland,'' said Ms. Pellin, 44. The Italian bureaucracy is crushing, she said, and the professionalism is greater in Switzerland. Moreover, Swiss laws require stores to close Sundays, unlike in Italy, where they stay open seven days a week. ''I have two kids,'' she said. ''It's about quality of life.''TOKYO -- The pink Toyota Crown sedan that took center stage at a holiday event here last week was meant to shock, and it did. The Crown, the preferred ride of staid Japanese executives, had received an edgy makeover. With a new oversize grille, vamped-up hybrid engine and an unveiling at a fashion mall, there was nothing stodgy about this car. ''Reborn,'' read a logo beamed onto a large screen. ''My initial reaction was: 'You're kidding! Please, not pink,' '' Akio Toyoda, the Toyota chief executive and a scion of the Japanese automaker's founding family, told reporters at the event. ''But being reborn does mean taking on new challenges.'' Toyota has spent much of the last year trying to leave behind what has been a tumultuous four years in which the automaker booked its largest loss ever, became embroiled in a recall scandal, struggled with a decimated supply chain after the 2011 tsunami and weathered the punishing effects of a strong yen. One by one, the pieces have been falling into place. In 2012, Toyota leapfrogged General Motors and Volkswagen to regain its title as the world's largest automaker, selling 9.7 million vehicles, a record for the company. Now the company is on the cusp of a recovery, analysts say, that could put it on track to post the kind of growth promised before the crises. ''Toyota is now in the position -- for the first time in years -- where it is beating market expectations while its peers are disappointing,'' Clive Wiggins, a Tokyo-based autos analyst for Macquarie, said in a recent note to clients. ''We expect earnings to continue beating expectations over the next three years.'' Last week, Toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a class-action suit over claims that its electronic malfunctions caused its cars to accelerate without warning, one of the largest payouts ever for an automotive lawsuit. Toyota still faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, as well as an unfair business practices case brought by 28 attorneys general in the United States. But the company's $1.1 billion charge against earnings for the class action was seen as a significant step toward closing the chapter on its recall problems. There have been other signs of change. The company supply chain bounced back more quickly than predicted, profits are on the rise and the yen has started to weaken after the newly installed prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised to drive down that currency. And there is a loud message of change being sounded through the stepped-up emphasis on design -- with both Toyota and Lexus models getting new looks, including the pink Crown. ''It's actually a beautiful color,'' Mr. Toyoda said. Toyota's rebound has been centered in the United States, where its sales increased 28.8 percent last year to 1.88 million vehicles through November. That's more than double the industrywide increase of 13.9 percent over the same period. The biggest contributors have been stalwart products such as the Camry, and the expanded line of Prius hybrid models. Through November, combined sales of Prius cars had risen 81.3 percent in 2012, as the company continued to dominate the hybrid segment. The company is also betting on a revamped version of a perennial also-ran, the Avalon sedan. Sales of the current version of the car were down 5 percent last year. The new model, with its wide-mouth grille and sculptured headlamps, reflects the company's efforts to appeal to younger buyers. Toyota is trying to shave 10 years off the average age of buyers, now in the mid-60s. The Avalon, which was designed and engineered in Michigan and is being built at Toyota's assembly plant in Kentucky, is also a test of how much Japanese officials can delegate decision-making to the company's subsidiaries. Promoted as Toyota's most American vehicle ever, the Avalon is the first Toyota prototype not developed in Japan but at the sprawling Toyota Technical Center near Ann Arbor, Mich., where 1,100 employees work. ''We didn't have to go back to Japan for approval on everything,'' said Randy Stephens, the chief engineer on the Avalon. ''We might go back to review the status of the project, but there is a feeling of ownership of this car here.'' By shifting more production overseas from Japan, Toyota is also addressing a critical weakness in its production setup: that it still makes the bulk of its cars in high-cost Japan, where the strong yen of recent years has weighed on the automaker's bottom line. Through line closures and reorganization, Toyota is slashing its production capacity in Japan from nearly four million to around three million by 2014. It has increased overseas production capacity by one million, opening new factories or expanding existing ones in the United States, China, Thailand, Indonesia, India and Brazil. For every one-yen drop in the value of the dollar, Toyota loses 35 billion yen (roughly $400 million) in operating profit. Delegating responsibilities more globally has also been a pressing task as Toyota digs out of its recall crisis. At the time, Toyota was criticized over its seeming need to coordinate every decision from its Toyota City headquarters, thousands of miles away, which American regulators said contributed to large delays in issuing global recalls for known problems. Toyota says it has overhauled its quality control setup and given broad powers to regional executives in charge of safety in North America, Europe and Asia. Company executives at the time said that customer complaints would be tracked more closely and necessary recalls issued more quickly. Those changes appear to be a work in progress. Last month, Toyota agreed to pay a $17.35 million fine -- Toyota's fourth since 2010 and the maximum amount allowable -- to settle allegations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the automaker delayed a safety recall. The safety agency contended that over 150,000 2010 Lexus and RX sport utility vehicles recalled in June should have been included in a 2009 recall of 3.8 million vehicles for the same issue. Toyota did not admit any wrongdoing and said it was paying the fine to avoid a continued dispute with the safety agency. Nevertheless, it is clear that Toyota needs to rebuild confidence. Since the start of its recall crisis in late 2009, when the automaker issued its first recall for sticky accelerator pedals and floor mats that could trap such pedals, Toyota has recalled about 20 million vehicles globally, surpassing all other automakers. In its latest large-scale global recall, in October, Toyota said it would fix 7.43 million vehicles for faulty power window switches. In August, the company also recalled crossover S.U.V.'s and Lexus hybrids for faulty rear suspension arms that could separate, causing the driver to lose control. Still, analysts say Toyota's sales numbers show that consumers are giving the automaker's fuel-efficient cars another chance, after a dedicated crisis public relations campaign including visits by a teary Mr. Toyoda to auto dealers in the United States and appeals on YouTube from top executives. ''Despite two recent large-volume recalls, we think the Toyota brand is back and that many new and refreshed vehicles will boost global volumes,'' Efraim Levy, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said in a recent report. One danger that looms large on Toyota's horizon is tumbling sales in China, with which Japan is engaged in a bitter spat over a set of uninhabited islands between the two countries. Toyota's sales in China fell as much as half after protesters staged anti-Japanese rallies across China and consumers there boycotted Japanese brands. In response, Toyota has shaved 50,000 units from its vehicle sales outlook for the year through March, and now expects to sell 8.75 million units. It also adjusted its revenue outlook to 21.3 trillion yen, down from 22 trillion, a figure nevertheless 15 percent higher than the previous year. Over all, though, executives say the company's various setbacks have given Toyota the license to take risks it might not have taken in the past. During the development of the new Avalon, for example, the Toyota organization was reeling from the recalls associated with unintended acceleration, said Mr. Stephens, the chief engineer. ''It was a terrible time, but it created an opportunity to change,'' he said. He recalled a presentation of the Avalon prototype in early 2010 to Mr. Toyoda, the chief executive, who wholeheartedly embraced the changes. ''He wanted us to be aggressive,'' Mr. Stephens said.CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Anyone who knows the history of this town would be surprised to find a fashionable coffee shop on Third Street, with dozens of people walking by. The lattes and chai teas are being sold on a Kendall Square site that had been empty for most of the last 40 years -- since factories with names like American Rubber and the Badger Company were razed for a NASA facility that was never built. Instead, the land lay fallow for decades, even as spinoff companies from the adjacent Massachusetts Institute of Technology transformed the neighborhood into a major research hub. But now, this corner of Cambridge is at the center of a real estate boom. ''You sit here and you'd never know there's a recession going on anywhere else in the country,'' Travis McCready, executive director of the Kendall Square Association, said over chai tea recently at Voltage Coffee & Art. Cranes are busy on eight separate construction sites in this area, and roughly two million square feet of space is being built or renovated or is under city review here. An additional 1.4 million new square feet is committed, and more is expected elsewhere in this city of 106,000, located directly across the Charles River from the city of Boston. If it all gets built, the new investment in Cambridge will come close to $2 billion. ''It's one of the hottest submarkets in the country,'' said Steven Purpura, managing partner of Richards Barry Joyce & Partners, a commercial real estate firm based in Boston. ''Top two or three for sure.'' Most of that growth is connected to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including new buildings for Pfizer and Novartis. Amazon just revealed plans to rent 100,000 square feet here; Google is expanding its footprint by 40,000 square feet; and Microsoft, I.B.M. and Nokia are nearby. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally preferred suburban enclaves where they could protect their intellectual property in more secluded settings and meet their employees' needs. But in recent years, as the costs of drug development have soared and R.& D. pipelines slowed, pharmaceutical companies have looked elsewhere for innovation. Much of that novelty is now coming from biotechnology firms and major research universities like M.I.T. and Harvard, just two subway stops away. ''People are putting their pride away and working with who they need to work with,'' said George A. Scangos, chief executive of Biogen Idec. Mr. Scangos's company illustrates the trend. When he took the helm at Biogen in 2010, his predecessor had just relocated the company's headquarters to the suburban town of Weston, leaving its scientists behind in Cambridge, a half-hour's drive away. Mr. Scangos thought the separation was bad for the company, but rather than move the scientists, he decided to bring the company back to town. Biogen is now the anchor tenant of a $500 million, 1.7-million-square-foot development being built by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, on the former urban renewal site. The rest of its 3,500 local employees will occupy a second building nearby also expected to be completed by late 2013 by Boston Properties. ''It's an amazing place to be,'' Mr. Scangos said. ''The intellectual firepower that is in Cambridge, between Harvard and M.I.T. and the number of companies, is quite remarkable.'' Pfizer also chose Cambridge when it was looking to consolidate some of its research operations. In 2011, the pharmaceutical giant announced it would move 400 research jobs to a new building on M.I.T.-owned land in Cambridge, even as it was closing facilities in Groton, Conn., and elsewhere. That $300 million, 180,000-square-foot building is expected to be completed later this year. Novartis, one of the first giant pharmaceutical companies to set up major operations in Cambridge, is adding two buildings to its campus on Massachusetts Avenue. They will occupy a combined 550,000 square feet at a cost of $600 million when they open in 2015. And a fourth pharmaceutical company, Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company, hopes to double its Cambridge footprint, occupying a 250,000-square-foot building proposed in Central Square, just down Massachusetts Avenue from M.I.T. Trends in philanthropy are helping Cambridge, as well. Large donations from private philanthropies helped build the $200 million David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, completed last year on the M.I.T. campus, in addition to a second, 250,000-square-foot building for the Broad Institute, a genetics research institute spun off from Harvard and M.I.T. The Ragon Institute, a collaborative venture of M.I.T., Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital to support AIDS vaccine research, will move into a nearby building now being renovated. Another boost is coming from area hospitals. Five Harvard-affiliated hospitals and Harvard Medical School are clustered in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. While that area is nearly built out, Kendall Square is one stop on the rail line from Mass General, the other Harvard-affiliated flagship hospital, providing easy collaboration. Mr. Scangos said he liked to look out his office window and see all his competitors. When he goes downstairs to lunch, he has choices now, beyond the food trucks and cafeterias that were the only options a few years ago. Although the closest drugstore and market are still a 20-minute walk away, that may change soon, too. Over the last seven years, 1,000 housing units have opened up in Kendall Square, adding to demand for such stores, Mr. McCready said. And last month, M.I.T. formally filed a rezoning petition with the city to turn 26 acres near its red line subway stop into a ''gateway'' for the campus, along with nearly 1 million square feet of office space and 240,000 square feet for housing units. ''All in all, it's a pretty exciting time,'' said Robert Healy, Cambridge's city manager for more than three decades. ''This is not the best of economic times. Yet there's still the faith being shown in Cambridge by virtue of what's in the ground and going up now.''Energy drinks are the fastest-growing part of the beverage industry, with sales in the United States reaching more than $10 billion in 2012 -- more than Americans spent on iced tea or sports beverages like Gatorade. Their rising popularity represents a generational shift in what people drink, and reflects a successful campaign to convince consumers, particularly teenagers, that the drinks provide a mental and physical edge. The drinks are now under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration after reports of deaths and serious injuries that may be linked to their high caffeine levels. But however that review ends, one thing is clear, interviews with researchers and a review of scientific studies show: the energy drink industry is based on a brew of ingredients that, apart from caffeine, have little, if any benefit for consumers. ''If you had a cup of coffee you are going to affect metabolism in the same way,'' said Dr. Robert W. Pettitt, an associate professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato, who has studied the drinks. Energy drink companies have promoted their products not as caffeine-fueled concoctions but as specially engineered blends that provide something more. For example, producers claim that ''Red Bull gives you wings,'' that Rockstar Energy is ''scientifically formulated'' and Monster Energy is a ''killer energy brew.'' Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat, has asked the government to investigate the industry's marketing claims. Promoting a message beyond caffeine has enabled the beverage makers to charge premium prices. A 16-ounce energy drink that sells for $2.99 a can contains about the same amount of caffeine as a tablet of NoDoz that costs 30 cents. Even Starbucks coffee is cheap by comparison; a 12-ounce cup that costs $1.85 has even more caffeine. As with earlier elixirs, a dearth of evidence underlies such claims. Only a few human studies of energy drinks or the ingredients in them have been performed and they point to a similar conclusion, researchers say -- that the beverages are mainly about caffeine. Caffeine is called the world's most widely used drug. A stimulant, it increases alertness, awareness and, if taken at the right time, improves athletic performance, studies show. Energy drink users feel its kick faster because the beverages are typically swallowed quickly or are sold as concentrates. ''These are caffeine delivery systems,'' said Dr. Roland Griffiths, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who has studied energy drinks. ''They don't want to say this is equivalent to a NoDoz because that is not a very sexy sales message.'' A scientist at the University of Wisconsin became puzzled as he researched an ingredient used in energy drinks like Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy and Monster Energy. The researcher, Dr. Craig A. Goodman, could not find any trials in humans of the additive, a substance with the tongue-twisting name of glucuronolactone that is related to glucose, a sugar. But Dr. Goodman, who had studied other energy drink ingredients, eventually found two 40-year-old studies from Japan that had examined it. In the experiments, scientists injected large doses of the substance into laboratory rats. Afterward, the rats swam better. ''I have no idea what it does in energy drinks,'' Dr. Goodman said. Energy drink manufacturers say it is their proprietary formulas, rather than specific ingredients, that provide users with physical and mental benefits. But that has not prevented them from implying otherwise. Consider the case of taurine, an additive used in most energy products. On its Web site, the producer of Red Bull, for example, states that ''more than 2,500 reports have been published about taurine and its physiological effects,'' including acting as a ''detoxifying agent.'' In addition, that company, Red Bull of Austria, points to a 2009 safety study by a European regulatory group that gave it a clean bill of health. But Red Bull's Web site does not mention reports by that same group, the European Food Safety Authority, which concluded that claims about the benefits in energy drinks lacked scientific support. Based on those findings, the European Commission has refused to approve claims that taurine helps maintain mental function and heart health and reduces muscle fatigue. Taurine, an amino acidlike substance that got its name because it was first found in the bile of bulls, does play a role in bodily functions, and recent research suggests it might help prevent heart attacks in women with high cholesterol. However, most people get more than adequate amounts from foods like meat, experts said. And researchers added that those with heart problems who may need supplements would find far better sources than energy drinks. A spokeswoman for Red Bull did not respond directly to the European marketing claims report but said that the company did ''not make claims for individual ingredients but rather for the product in its entirety.'' To woo consumers, companies have also used another tactic -- including huge amounts of well-known nutrients that make for eye-catching numbers on labels. For example, a two-ounce bottle of 5-Hour Energy contains 500 micrograms of Vitamin B12, or 8,333 percent of the recommended daily allowance. The energy shot also has 20 times the recommended intake of Vitamin B6. B-group vitamins serve many functions, such as in the digestion of food. But several experts said that healthy people get adequate amounts of them from food and that huge added dosages do not provide benefits. ''They are not going to increase energy levels,'' said Paul R. Thomas, a scientific adviser with the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements. Elaine Lutz, a spokeswoman for the distributor of 5-Hour Energy, Living Essentials of Farmington Hills, Mich., said the amounts of B vitamins used were safe and effective. ''The body is going to use what it needs and it is going to excrete what it does not absorb,'' said Ms. Lutz. The sugar found in some drinks does provide a quick source of energy. But as for glucuronolactone, the additive that made rats swim better, the authors of a recent report in a scientific journal, Nutrition Reviews, said they were clueless as to why it was used in the products or what it did. ''Certainly, this is one ingredient for which evidence-based studies are needed to justify its popularity,'' wrote the researchers. That same review, which examined all published energy drink studies, also concluded that there was an ''overwhelming lack of evidence to substantiate claims'' that drink ingredients, apart from caffeine and sugar, provided any benefits. The roots of the energy drink phenomenon -- and the claims surrounding ingredient mixes -- can be traced to Japan. Those origins appear tied to the emergence of supposed cure-alls after World War II, a time when drugs there were in short supply. In the late 1940s, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese drug maker, began selling taurine extract, apparently drawn to it by accounts citing its wartime use by the Japanese Imperial Navy to reduce fatigue among sailors and sharpen their vision at night, a history of the drug company states. ''A formula that is so effective in treating unexplained fevers, neuralgia, fatigue, whooping cough and other conditions for which there is no drug is very rare indeed,'' an advertisement for the extract declared. But around 1960, Taisho executives decided to use taurine in a new product, one that helped start the energy drink industry -- Lipovitan D. Lipovitan D, which was sold in a small vial, contained 50 milligrams of caffeine, 1,000 milligrams of taurine, various B vitamins and flavorings. The product, which was sold cold in drugstores, was a huge success during Japan's economic boom years, particularly with overworked office employees. However, 50 years and 34 billion bottles later, Taisho officials acknowledged they had not run a single clinical study involving Lipovitan D or taurine. ''Taurine is added to Lipovitan D not so much for specific medicinal benefits but for its multifaceted functions,'' said Dr. Takanori Kouchiwa, a Taisho executive. It was also in the 1960s that a product appeared in Thailand that was similar to Lipovitan D in its ingredient mix. It was called Krating Daeng (pronounced grating deng), or Red Bull. An Austrian businessman named Dietrich Mateschitz reportedly discovered it when trying to cure a case of jet lag and, in 1987, he and the drink's Thai creator founded Red Bull. Red Bull quickly became popular in Europe with truck drivers and students and as a mixer for alcoholic drinks. It arrived in the United States in the late 1990s and soon inspired hundreds of competitors. In 2002, for example, Monster Energy was marketed in a 16-ounce can, twice as large as Red Bull's 8-ounce can and with twice as much caffeine. Over the years, some producers have financed scientific studies to try to bolster performance claims. A British researcher, Dr. Chris Alford, said that Red Bull approached him about a decade ago while he was doing work on the ability of stimulants to reduce fatigue in drivers. In 2001, Dr. Alford, a psychologist at the University of the West of England in Bristol who has received financing from Red Bull, published a study that found test participants given the energy drink had better reaction times, were more alert and showed increased physical endurance than test subjects given a placebo like flavored water. But studies like Dr. Alford's, researchers say, only underscore caffeine's known benefits. And more recent attempts to tease out the impacts of drink ingredients have produced mixed results. Last August, Scottish researchers reported that 1,000 milligrams of taurine taken as a supplement appeared to improve the performance of middle-distance runners. But other taurine studies have been negative or inconclusive. ''We found it difficult to make any conclusions about what taurine was doing,'' said a graduate researcher at Tufts University, Grace Giles, who headed a study that ran participants through a battery of mental reaction and memory tests. Dr. Goodman, the University of Wisconsin researcher, said he believed there was a reason for such equivocal results. The scientist, who works at the school's college of veterinary medicine, said that laboratory animals, like mice or rats, must be given huge dosages of taurine to see an effect. ''You can force a mouse to drink a lot of taurine,'' said Dr. Goodman. ''With humans, it is harder to do.'' What may qualify as the strangest trial in the annals of energy drink studies was financed by Living Essentials, the distributor of 5-Hour Energy. The office of a proctologist in a small Maine town apparently served as a setting for the 2007 study, the results of which were never published. But its findings and other details about it, like its location, emerged in a 2008 lawsuit filed by the maker of Monster Energy against Living Essentials. The study found that test subjects given 5-Hour Energy experienced ''energy'' for about 40 minutes longer than when given Red Bull or Monster Energy, though it was not clear from court papers whether that difference reflected the energy shot's higher levels of caffeine. But another finding from that study sheds an interesting light on one of 5-Hour Energy's central claims -- that the energy shot, unlike competitors', produces ''No Crash Later.'' According to the study, 24 percent of test participants who received 5-Hour Energy had reactions similar to a ''moderately severe crash that left them extremely tired and in need of rest, another drink or some other action,'' lawsuit filings show. Ms. Lutz, the Living Essentials spokeswoman, said the bold ''No Crash Later'' statement on product labels was followed by a special mark. That mark, which also appears on the back label, explains in fine print that ''no crash means no sugar crash.'' That is hardly surprising, because 5-Hour Energy does not contain sugar. Asked whether consumers mistakenly believe that the shot does not produce a caffeine-related crash, Ms. Lutz said that the use of the special mark and its explanation were clear. ''I don't believe that it is misleading,'' said Ms. Lutz, who added that the advertising division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus had approved the ''No Crash Later'' claim. She added that another study showing the benefits of 5-Hour Energy was undergoing ''peer review'' for possible publication in a scientific journal. But she declined to say why the results of the study, which was apparently conducted five years ago, had not yet appeared. That study found a benefit when 5-Hour Energy was compared to a placebo like flavored water, she said. Whatever the case, the energy drink boom has come full circle in Asia, the region where it started. Over the last decade, sales of Lipovitan D have fallen and its maker, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, has tried various strategies to revitalize the brand. Among them: bringing out Lipovitan Junior, a caffeine-free version for children. In Thailand, Krating Daeng has suffered a similar fate. Its producer has tried to freshen up that brand by proclaiming that the Vitamin B12 in it ''helps the functions of the nervous system and brain.'' Last year, the Foundation for Consumers in Thailand, an advocacy group, started a publicity campaign against energy drinks like Krating Daeng, arguing that producers were promoting unfounded health claims to push caffeine. ''This product just needed a way to add value to extend its life cycle,'' said Patchara Klaewkla, an official at the foundation. ''This product has been in the market for a long time.'' 5-Hour Energy contains quantities of Vitamin B12 that dietary experts say offer no real benefits to those who take it.

While apartments are routinely sold using splashy, multifaceted ad campaigns, commercial brokers and developers have favored lower-key, brochure-based approaches. But the two branches of the family may be growing closer. In recent months, the marketing teams for some New York office buildings have decided to get the word out by deploying the type of stylish Web sites once used only by luxury condominiums. Unlike the Web sites of office buildings past, which tended to be bare-bones and buried deep within a landlord's corporate home page, this new crop stands alone and crackles with animation, exuberant language and videos. And by publicizing details like where telecom cables enter the building, these sites add transparency to a business that can seem clubby and secretive. ''Lunches with brokers is an old-school way of getting your message out,'' said Grant Greenspan, a broker and principal at the Kaufman Organization, a landlord that has set up Web sites for two of its buildings, 100-104 Fifth Avenue and 550 Seventh Avenue. But, he added, ''it's only as good as the group of brokers who you perceive to have the clients.'' By introducing buildings to the public online to generate demand, Mr. Greenspan said, ''you get clients going to their brokers and saying, 'Why aren't you showing me this building?' '' The site for 100-104 Fifth Avenue, a pair of joined, early-20th-century buildings near Union Square that Kaufman co-owns with Invesco Real Estate, was also useful in chronicling the $15 million renovation that occurred after the development team bought the property out of bankruptcy in 2010 for $94 million. The renovation, which took two years, included adding a fire safety system and six elevators and redesigning a pair of lobbies. All of this is described in a colorful, animated timeline on the Web site, 100-104fifth.com, as are the specifics about those telecom cables. The Kaufman Organization credited the site with helping to fill the 270,000-square-foot building quickly. It is at 98 percent occupancy today, up from 60 percent when the landlord bought it. According to Mr. Greenspan, all six tenants signed there since 2010 said the site had played a major role in piquing their interest. Those tenants include Yelp, the online review business; Apple's iAd, an advertising network; and Net-a-Porter, a women's apparel retailer. They pay rents ranging from $45 to $60 per square foot, Kaufman said. Similarly, at 550 Seventh Avenue, which Kaufman recently began managing for Adler Group, a new Web site is being used to rebrand the 12-story building in the garment district, where fashion tenants have historically held sway. The Web site, 550seventhave.com, may surprise property owners who tend to be tight-lipped about their tenants. It shows the directory in the building's lobby, revealing that Lilly Pulitzer, Donna Karan International and Oscar de la Renta have offices inside. The site, introduced in October, is already paying off. An 11,000-square-foot space on the 10th floor is expected to be leased this month to a software company, Mr. Greenspan said, adding that the $30,000 cost of making both sites, plus the hours logged by a full-time worker, had been worth every penny. If Web sites ''facilitate renting the spaces 60 or 90 days sooner, they make all the sense in the world,'' he said. Some major New York landlords, like the Chetrit Group, have no online presence. And even when Web sites do exist, they can be a bit stolid, offering little more than the year the building was completed, its architect and its total square footage, as with the General Motors Building, owned by Boston Properties. Brokers say that when a high-rise has existed for years and is one of Manhattan's prized addresses as well, it may not have to promote itself online. A new office building must do more, especially when it hasn't even come out of the ground yet. In those cases, a Web site is essential to allow tenants to visualize their future home, said Christopher V. Albanese, president of the Albanese Organization, a Long Island-based developer. These sites tend to be extremely eye-catching and could easily be mistaken for ones intended to sell multimillion-dollar condos. In November, the Albanese Organization unveiled 510w22.com, for 510 West 22nd Street, a planned 170,000-square-foot office building in West Chelsea. The centerpiece of the artful Web site is a four-minute video narrated by the architect Rick Cook, which brims with dramatic music and soaring shots of the adjacent High Line. Creating such a Hollywood-caliber product, which includes renderings that normally would not have been commissioned, doubled the building's marketing budget -- ''but without it, tenants might think that this was just some ordinary building, and it really isn't,'' Mr. Albanese said. Also, financing for the $150 million project cannot be secured until the building is 30 percent leased, he said, making a dynamic marketing tool all the more important. Though online videos for commercial real estate are not widespread, they are gaining in popularity. The Web site for 7 Bryant Park, a 28-story office building that Hines is developing on Avenue of the Americas, features a two-minute video. A piano tinkles; the camera swoops. The site, 7bryantpark.com, introduced last winter, has not led to leases yet, but George C. Lancaster, Hines's senior vice president of communications, said to expect similar branding for future projects. Web sites are ''the first place anybody goes these days to shop for clothes or office space,'' he said. Brian Lindvall, a partner at Dbox, which made Hines's video and the Web site for 510 West 22nd Street, agreed. Commercial assignments are coming in more frequently, he said, including one for the International Gem Tower, an Extell Development Company project at 50 West 47th Street. Multimedia Web sites ''have kind of been a residential tactic for a while,'' said Mr. Lindvall, who has worked on apartment projects for Rudin Management and Forest City Ratner. ''I think that relaying square footage and location is not enough to convey what a building represents.'' Like sites for condos, commercial real estate sites can seem to hawk lifestyles rather than places to put sofas or desks. For example, businesses are urged to lease space at 837 Washington Street, under construction in the meatpacking district, because of its proximity to the new Whitney Museum and an Apple store -- and, 837washington.com says, ''because when fashion arrived, restaurateurs and hoteliers followed.'' The six-story, 55,000-square-foot, $100 million project is expected to be completed in 2014. Asking rents for the offices are $100 per square foot, said Paul E. Pariser, co-chief executive of Taconic Investment Partners, which is developing the building with Thor Equities. According to Mr. Pariser, who sold 111 Eighth Avenue to Google in 2010, the tech companies that will most likely rent the space care about the hipness of their neighborhood. ''They don't want some stuffy image that says, 'I have a Madison Avenue address,' '' he said. If Web sites help landlords leapfrog brokers to some degree by taking their message to the masses, the brokers don't seem overly concerned. Bruce Mosler, co-chairman of the brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, said he was glad technology had advanced enough to portray large offices compellingly online. He added that condos were ahead of the game only because apartments are simpler to depict. Besides, brokers still need to be at the negotiating table when a lease is signed. ''It will allow the product to get to the market more quickly,'' Mr. Mosler said. ''This town recognizes the value of what brokerages and brokers can provide.''Eduardo Porter, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is off.  SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation's capital and overseas. In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans' video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings. But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking. Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation -- meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack -- that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry's main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down. The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration. ''Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,'' said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. ''The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair's own priorities.'' In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet. At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web. The key to the industry's successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. ''Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,'' said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel. ''Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,'' he continued, ''to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn't unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.'' At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city. Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates. In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley's lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen. Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period. Among Google's advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google's office in Washington. Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google's search engine results favor Google products over its rivals'. Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January. The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements. Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election. Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans' video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook. The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in ''unfair and deceptive practices'' when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years. Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users' pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment. ''Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.'' Silicon Valley's lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent. One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals.ORTLEY BEACH, N.J. -- Stefanie Pyper's last prehurricane memory of her house on Fourth Avenue is one of bliss: the bike ride up to the Lavallette Boardwalk, seeing a school of dolphins in the ocean, the oasis of calm amid the turmoil of raising five children ranging in age from 8 to 18. So after Hurricane Sandy devastated its ground floor, ruining everything inside, and turned the yard into a landfill -- littering it with a Porta-Potty, a refrigerator, a television, pieces of the Ortley Beach Boardwalk and the rest -- all she could think when she came back to begin cleaning up was that this is like being in mourning, this feels like a death. And then Hurricane Sandy gave way to Sandy Hook Elementary, where the death was all too real and the mourning was for 6- and 7-year-olds and beloved educators, not for a treasured beach house and good times with good friends. It's not that disaster is a game of perverse one-upmanship where the greater catastrophe cancels out one not quite as awful. But, still, after that, it was hard for Ms. Pyper not to see Ortley's disaster through the lens of the disaster in Newtown, Conn. ''It put a whole different spin on life in general and on what we're going through,'' said Ms. Pyper, a former fourth-grade teacher in the Newark schools. ''Of course, this is terrible, but we can take a deep breath and say this will get done. Those people are not going to see their kids again. To see what they're going through, it humbles you.'' Ortley was perhaps the hardest-hit beach town in New Jersey, with virtually all 2,400 homes damaged, about 10 percent of them destroyed. And while residents and businesses are slowly returning home in Seaside Heights to the south and Lavallette to the north, there is still no electricity, gas or water in any homes or businesses in Ortley Beach. There were deaths in Hurricane Sandy, of course -- none in Ortley Beach, but more than 100 elsewhere in New Jersey, in New York and in Connecticut, including little children snatched from their mother's arms -- caused by the winds and a great storm surge. But nature's wrath over a broad area seems at least comprehensible. Maria Muscarella spent New Year's last year at the beach house her parents, Anthony and Raffaela Muscarella, bought in 1963. Mr. Muscarella, a Newark firefighter who lovingly built up the small bungalow year by year, expanding the first floor and adding a second in 1979, died in 1996. Maria's brother, also named Anthony, and mother lived there year-round before the storm flooded it with five feet of water. So on Dec. 31, 2011, there was dinner at Hemingway's Cafe in Seaside Heights with her brother and the Watsons from across the street. They all rang in the new year together and had a traditional Italian dinner the next day at the Muscarella home, a celebration of family, friendship and things that seemed eternal, like the gathering every Memorial Day to kick off the summer. They plan to rebuild, but it won't be by Memorial Day. For now, Raffaela Muscarella, 86, is living with Maria in Maplewood, and Anthony is with a friend in Toms River. But the carnage in Newtown put their own loss in a different light. ''There really isn't any comparison,'' Maria Muscarella said. ''We lost things and we can replace those things. They lost children and lives. Those are irreplaceable.'' And along with the perspective on grief, there's perspective on the half-life of tragedy. So along with the horror at what happened in Newtown, Susan Notte could not but think what it meant for the public visibility of the storm victims. ''When I picked up the newspaper the next day, I thought, 'Well, that's the end of Hurricane Sandy,' '' she said. ''We had the aftermath of Sandy, the devastation of Sandy, the heroes of Sandy, the cleanup of Sandy, and then boom, it's over, except for the people who still live here.'' On Fourth Avenue on a recent Thursday, there was not a soul around, just the wreckage, the sea breeze and the forlorn Christmas tableau at the Politis' house -- its front ripped off, showing a tattered American flag, a Christmas wreath under lifeless ceiling fans and a sad-eyed concrete angel alone on a table. But up on the main drag of Route 35, there are now traffic lights blinking orange and red. You can get sandwiches, cappuccino and cigars at the Quik Stop in Lavallette. In Seaside Heights, two of the familiar businesses, Ryan's Deli and Steaks Unlimited, reopened the week before Christmas. At Steaks Unlimited, the area's most famous habitués were strutting and preening their way through an episode of ''Jersey Shore'' on two flat-screen televisions, a dopey reminder amid devastation of the sublime appeal of everyday life in all its glory and banality. At the Jersey Shore, if not in Newtown, it still seemed within reach.

But the rhinoceros carcasses kept piling up around them, and it was only after dozens of these hulking, relatively rare animals were dead and their precious horns sawed off that an extravagant scheme came to light. The Thai women, it ends up, were not hunters at all. Many never even squeezed off a shot. Instead, they were prostitutes hired by a criminal syndicate based 6,000 miles away in Laos to exploit loopholes in big-game hunting rules and get its hands on as many rhino horns as possible -- horns that are now worth more than gold. ''These girls had no idea what they were doing,'' said Paul O'Sullivan, a private investigator in Johannesburg who helped crack the case. ''They thought they were going on safari.'' The rhino horn rush has gotten so out of control that it has exploded into a worldwide criminal enterprise, drawing in a surreal cast of characters -- not just Thai prostitutes, but also Irish gangsters, Vietnamese diplomats, Chinese scientists, veterinarians, copter pilots, antiques dealers and recently an American rodeo star looking for a quick buck who used Facebook to find some horns. Driven by a common belief in Asia that ground-up rhino horns can cure cancer and other ills, the trade has also been embraced by criminal syndicates that normally traffic drugs and guns, but have branched into the underground animal parts business because it is seen as ''low risk, high profit,'' American officials say. ''Get caught smuggling a kilo of cocaine, you will receive a very significant prison sentence,'' said Ed Grace, a deputy chief with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. But with a kilogram of rhino horn, he added, ''you may only get a fine.'' The typical rhino horn is about two feet long and 10 pounds, much of it formed from the same substance as fingernails. Yet it can fetch nearly $30,000 a pound, more than crack cocaine, and conservationists worry that this ''ridiculous price,'' as one wildlife manager put it, could drive rhinos into extinction. Gangs are so desperate for new sources of horn that criminals have even smashed into dozens of glass museum cases all across Europe to snatch them from exhibits. ''Astonishment and rage, that's what we felt,'' said Paolo Agnelli, a manager at the Florence Museum of Natural History, after three rhino horns were stolen last year, including a very rare one from 1824. American federal agents recently staged a cross-country undercover rhino horn sting operation, called Operation Crash, ''crash'' being the term for a herd of rhinos. Among the 12 people arrested: Wade Steffen, a champion steer wrestler from Texas, who pleaded guilty in May to trafficking dozens of horns that he found through hunters, estate sales and Facebook; and two members of an Irish gang -- the same gang suspected of breaking into the museums in Europe. In an e-mail to an undercover agent, an Irish gangster bragged: ''Believe me WE NEVER LOSES A HORN TO CUSTOMS, we have so many contacts and people payed off now we can bring anything we want out of nearly any country into Europe.'' Corruption is a huge element, just like in the illegal ivory trade, in which rebel groups, government armies and threadbare hunters have been wiping out tens of thousands of elephants throughout Africa, selling the tusks to sophisticated criminal networks that move them across the globe with the help of corrupt officials. Here in South Africa, home to the majority of the world's last surviving 28,000 rhinos or so, the country is throwing just about everything it has to stop the slaughter -- thousands of rangers, the national army, a new spy plane, even drones -- but it is losing. The number of rhinos poached in South Africa has soared in the past five years, from 13 killed in 2007 to more than 630 in 2012. The prehistoric, battleship-gray animals are often found on their knees, bleeding to death from a gaping stump on their face. ''Ever seen a dead rhino?'' asked Philip Jonker, who works for a private security firm that has gone into wildlife protection. ''It's worse than going to a funeral.'' The only answer, some contend, is to legalize the trade, which would flood the market with rhino horns, lower the price and dissuade rhino poachers from risking their lives -- or so the argument goes. Rhino horns regenerate, and the horns can be shaved down every few years and sold off without significantly hurting the animal. One of most passionate advocates of this legalization movement is John Hume, a South African entrepreneur who now owns more than 800 rhinos, with names like Curly, Titan, Hillary and Pinocchio, and has amassed a 2,000-pound mountain of horn worth millions of dollars -- if he is ever allowed to sell it. ''Why shouldn't the person who breeds rhino get a reward?'' he asks. Every time Mr. Hume's ranch hands trim down a few rhinos, they organize an armed escort to take the horns straight to a safe-deposit box in a bank because the same gangs that waylay armored bank trucks are now cruising around South Africa looking for rhino horns. But many wildlife groups say legalizing the rhino trade would be a disaster. ''The consuming power in my country is growing so rapidly that the supply would never meet the needs,'' said Jeff He, spokesman for the Chinese branch of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ''And besides, it'll always be cheaper to poach an animal than raise it.'' Kruger National Park, an enormous wildlife refuge in South Africa's northeast, is where many rhinos are being poached. The park lies on the border with Mozambique, a much poorer country still scarred from years of civil war. Park rangers say Mozambican gunmen are pouring through Kruger's chain link fences, downing rhinos left and right. Some sophisticated poaching rings use helicopters to spot the animals and veterinarians to dart them with tranquilizers. Others don women's shoes, to leave misleading tracks. ''At any one time, there are up to 10 groups operating inside the Kruger,'' said Ken Maggs, a South African National Parks official. ''These guys are trying new methods daily.'' Scientists say that maybe a million rhinos once roamed the earth, and for some reason, humans have been fascinated with the horn for ages. The ancient Persians thought rhino horn vessels could detect poisons. The Chinese thought rhino horn powder could reduce fevers. The Yemenis prized the horn for coming-of-age daggers, presented to teenage boys as a sign of manhood. In Asia, faith in traditional cures runs strong, fueling demand as Asian economies grow, though there is no scientific proof that rhino horn can cure cancer. In 2008, a Vietnamese diplomat in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, was caught on camera receiving rhino horn -- in the parking lot of the embassy. Around the same time, a Chinese company opened a secretive rhino breeding center in Hainan Province, reportedly to produce rhino-based medicine. In the past 50 years, the overall rhino population has plummeted by more than 90 percent, despite an international ban on the trade in rhino parts since 1977. But in South Africa, it is legal to hunt rhinos, creating the loophole that the Thai prostitutes sauntered through. Hunters must agree to keep the horn set (rhinos have a large front and smaller back horn) as a trophy and not sell it, and hunters are allowed to kill only one white rhino every 12 months. (Black rhinos are critically endangered and very few are hunted in South Africa.) According to South African law enforcement officials, gang leaders in Thailand and Laos decided that to maximize the number of rhinos they could kill, they would enlist Thai prostitutes who were already in South Africa with valid passports, which were used for the hunting permits. The women then tagged along on the hunts, often dressed in catchy pinks and blues, but somebody else -- usually a professional hunter -- pulled the trigger. ''I don't know whose idea it was to use the ladies, but it was a damn good one,'' said Mr. O'Sullivan, the private investigator. None of the two dozen or so prostitutes involved have been prosecuted -- the intent was to get the big fish. So Mr. O'Sullivan leaked a photograph of an enormous stockpile of ivory and rhino horns to one of the women, along with a message for her boss, a bespectacled Thai man named Chumlong Lemtongthai, that everything was for sale: ''I wanted the big man himself to come here and negotiate.'' Mr. Lemtongthai did exactly that, and he was arrested soon after. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in November to 40 years. ''I do not want to see a situation where my grandchildren will only be able to see rhino in a picture,'' said the judge, Prince Manyathi. The Price of Ivory: Articles in this series are examining how the surge in poaching both feeds off and fuels instability in Africa.SAN FRANCISCO -- The antivirus industry has a dirty little secret: its products are often not very good at stopping viruses. Consumers and businesses spend billions of dollars every year on antivirus software. But these programs rarely, if ever, block freshly minted computer viruses, experts say, because the virus creators move too quickly. That is prompting start-ups and other companies to get creative about new approaches to computer security. ''The bad guys are always trying to be a step ahead,'' said Matthew D. Howard, a venture capitalist at Norwest Venture Partners who previously set up the security strategy at Cisco Systems. ''And it doesn't take a lot to be a step ahead.'' Computer viruses used to be the domain of digital mischief makers. But in the mid-2000s, when criminals discovered that malicious software could be profitable, the number of new viruses began to grow exponentially. In 2000, there were fewer than a million new strains of malware, most of them the work of amateurs. By 2010, there were 49 million new strains, according to AV-Test, a German research institute that tests antivirus products. The antivirus industry has grown as well, but experts say it is falling behind. By the time its products are able to block new viruses, it is often too late. The bad guys have already had their fun, siphoning out a company's trade secrets, erasing data or emptying a consumer's bank account. A new study by Imperva, a data security firm in Redwood City, Calif., and students from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is the latest confirmation of this. Amichai Shulman, Imperva's chief technology officer, and a group of researchers collected and analyzed 82 new computer viruses and put them up against more than 40 antivirus products, made by top companies like Microsoft, Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky Lab. They found that the initial detection rate was less than 5 percent. On average, it took almost a month for antivirus products to update their detection mechanisms and spot the new viruses. And two of the products with the best detection rates -- Avast and Emsisoft -- are available free; users are encouraged to pay for additional features. This despite the fact that consumers and businesses spent a combined $7.4 billion on antivirus software last year -- nearly half of the $17.7 billion spent on security software in 2011, according to Gartner. ''Existing methodologies we've been protecting ourselves with have lost their efficacy,'' said Ted Schlein, a security-focused investment partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. ''This study is just another indicator of that. But the whole concept of detecting what is bad is a broken concept.'' Part of the problem is that antivirus products are inherently reactive. Just as medical researchers have to study a virus before they can create a vaccine, antivirus makers must capture a computer virus, take it apart and identify its ''signature'' -- unique signs in its code -- before they can write a program that removes it. That process can take as little as a few hours or as long as several years. In May, researchers at Kaspersky Lab discovered Flame, a complex piece of malware that had been stealing data from computers for an estimated five years. Mikko H. Hypponen, chief researcher at F-Secure, called Flame ''a spectacular failure'' for the antivirus industry. ''We really should have been able to do better,'' he wrote in an essay for Wired.com after Flame's discovery. ''But we didn't. We were out of our league in our own game.'' Symantec and McAfee, which built their businesses on antivirus products, have begun to acknowledge their limitations and to try new approaches. The word ''antivirus'' does not appear once on their home pages. Symantec rebranded its popular antivirus packages: its consumer product is now called Norton Internet Security, and its corporate offering is now Symantec Endpoint Protection. ''Nobody is saying antivirus is enough,'' said Kevin Haley, Symantec's director of security response. Mr. Haley said Symantec's antivirus products included a handful of new technologies, like behavior-based blocking, which looks at some 30 characteristics of a file, including when it was created and where else it has been installed, before allowing it to run. ''In over two-thirds of cases, malware is detected by one of these other technologies,'' he said. Imperva, which sponsored the antivirus study, has a horse in this race. Its Web application and data security software are part of a wave of products that look at security in a new way. Instead of simply blocking what is bad, as antivirus programs and perimeter firewalls are designed to do, Imperva monitors access to servers, databases and files for suspicious activity. The day companies unplug their antivirus software is still far off, but entrepreneurs and investors are betting that the old tools will become relics. ''The game has changed from the attacker's standpoint,'' said Phil Hochmuth, a Web security analyst at the research firm International Data Corporation. ''The traditional signature-based method of detecting malware is not keeping up.'' Investors are backing a new crop of start-ups that turn the whole notion of security on its head. If it is no longer possible to block everything that is bad, the thinking goes, then the security companies of the future will be the ones whose software can spot unusual behavior and clean up systems once they have been breached. The hottest security start-ups today are companies like Bit9, Bromium, FireEye and Seculert that monitor Internet traffic, and companies like Mandiant and CrowdStrike that have expertise in cleaning up after an attack. Bit9, which received more than $70 million in financing from top venture firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, uses an approach known as whitelisting, allowing only traffic that the system knows is innocuous. McAfee acquired Solidcore, a whitelisting start-up, in 2009, and Symantec's products now include its Insight technology, which is similar in that it does not let any unknown files run on a machine. McAfee's former chief executive, David G. DeWalt, was rumored to be a contender for the top job at Intel, which acquired McAfee in 2010. Instead, he joined FireEye, a start-up with a system that isolates a company's applications in virtual containers, then looks for suspicious activity in a sort of digital petri dish before deciding whether to let traffic through. The company has received more than $35 million in financing from Norwest, Sequoia Capital and In-Q-Tel, the venture arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, among others. Seculert, an Israeli start-up, approaches the problem somewhat differently. It looks at where threats are coming from -- the command and control centers used to coordinate attacks -- to give governments and businesses an early warning system. As the number of prominent online attacks rises, analysts and venture capitalists are betting that corporate spending patterns will change. ''Technologies that once were only used by very sensitive industries like finance are moving into the mainstream,'' Mr. Hochmuth said. ''Very soon, if you are not running these technologies and you're a security professional, your colleagues and counterparts will start to look at you funny.'' Companies have started working from the assumption that they will be hacked, Mr. Hochmuth said, and that when they are, they will need top-notch cleanup crews. Mandiant, which specializes in data forensics and responding to breaches, has received $70 million from Kleiner Perkins and One Equity Partners, JPMorgan Chase's private investment arm. Two McAfee executives, George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch, left to start CrowdStrike, a start-up that offers a similar forensics service. Less than a year later, they have already raised $26 million from Warburg Pincus. If and when antivirus makers are able to fortify desktop computers, chances are the criminals will have already moved on to smartphones. In October, the F.B.I. warned that a number of malicious apps were compromising Android devices. And in July, Kaspersky Lab discovered the first malicious app in Apple's app store. The Defense Department has called for companies and universities to find ways to protect mobile devices from malware. McAfee, Symantec and others are working on solutions, and Lookout, a start-up whose products scan apps for malware and viruses, recently raised funding that valued it at $1 billion. ''The bad guys are getting worse,'' Mr. Howard of Norwest said. ''Antivirus helps filter down the problem, but the next big security company will be the one that offers a comprehensive solution.''A year ago, some thought 2012 was destined to be the year that the euro zone -- and maybe even the entire European Union -- broke up. The banks that supported their governments, and that in turn depended on those same governments for bailouts if they went broke, were deemed to be particularly vulnerable to disaster. It did not happen, and while the euro zone countries hardly solved their economic problems, the Continent's stock markets turned out to be good investments in 2012, with bank shares among the best performers. The same could be said about the United States, where the broad stock market posted double-digit gains and Bank of America shares doubled in 2012, albeit from a very depressed level. Over all, the Standard & Poor's Euro 350-stock index was up 13 percent for the year, measured in euros, and more than 15 percent measured in dollars. The S.& P. 500 wound up the year with a gain of 13 percent. It may have been typical of 2012 that it was politicians and central bankers -- not economic news or corporate developments -- that dominated investor attention. As the year ended, the difference was that it was Washington, not Europe, where the squabbles were taking place. For much of the year, it appeared that the European squabbles were leading nowhere, and by midsummer, markets were pessimistic about the outcome. Finally, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, took decisive action to assure that the banks -- and the governments that depended on them -- would have access to funds. That did not turn around recessionary conditions in much of the euro zone, but it was enough to turn around financial markets. Prices of government bonds in many of the most troubled countries began to rise. Those who bet that Europe would solve its problems did well in the financial markets. The accompanying charts show the performance of stocks in 10 economic sectors in both Europe and the United States, both in 2012 and since Oct. 9, 2007, the day that world stock markets peaked before what would turn out to be a world recession and credit crisis. What stands out is how well financial stocks and consumer discretionary stocks did during 2012. The latter stocks are things purchased by consumers that are likely to do better when the economy is improving. In the United States, the two best such stocks in the S.& P. 500 were PulteGroup, a homebuilder, and Whirlpool, an appliance maker. But while Europe did better in 2012, it remains much farther from recovering all of the losses experienced since the 2007 peak. The American index is just 9 percent lower than that, while the European index is about a third below where it was then. The only sectors that have completely made up their losses on both sides of the Atlantic are health care and consumer staples. In the United States, the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors have also done so, although the latter sector's performance is largely because of Apple, whose shares are more than three times as high as they were in 2007.The big story in the markets this year was not about stocks. Americans sold off their stock mutual funds, the most popular way to invest in American companies, at the fastest clip since 2008, the year the financial crisis began. That occurred despite the fact that the stock market itself rose steadily; the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the year up 13.4 percent. Investors have been opting instead for the assumed safety of bonds. Money has been steadily flowing into mutual funds holding bonds of all sorts for the last four years, but the pace accelerated this year. The percentage of household investments in bonds shot up to 26 percent from 14 percent just five years ago, according to Morningstar. Entering the new year, a growing number of professional investors are betting that the craze for bonds has gone too far, perhaps dangerously so, as has been evident in the headlines from the year-end reports from large investment firms. ''Bond PAIN in 2013?'' Wells Capital Management's chief strategist asked. ''Caution: Turn Ahead,'' BlackRock analysts wrote. ''The inflection year,'' said Bank of America. This is not the first time that analysts have forecast an end to the rally in bond values that has lasted for decades. But previously many of the voices predicting it were pessimists who believed that investors would sell off their bonds when they lost faith in the American government's ability to pay back its bonds, forcing the government and many other bond issuers to pay higher interest rates. When interest rates rise, older bonds with lower interest rates are worth less. While those previous forecasts have proved expensively wrong, this year the forecasters are being joined by many economic optimists who argue that a strengthening American economy is likely to make investors willing to embrace the risks involved in stocks, luring them out of bonds. The question, they say, is only how quickly it will happen. ''Mathematically, it's next to impossible to get the kind of returns on bonds you've seen over the last few years,'' said Kate Moore, the chief global equity strategist at Bank of America. When the turn does ultimately come, it is likely to cause pain for at least some of the people who have been investing in bonds in recent years. ''You don't want to be the last one out the door when the trends turn,'' said Rebecca H. Patterson, the chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. ''All good things come to an end and we want to make sure we're in front of it.'' Most of the talk of investors shifting money from bonds into stocks relies first on the assumption that politicians in Washington are able to resolve the current impasse over the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will go into effect if Congress and President Obama do not come to an agreement, and the coming debate over the nation's debt ceiling. (Late Monday evening, the two sides crept closer to a deal, tentatively agreeing to raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.) But a number of surveys suggest that professional investors are already starting to prepare for a shift. Hedge funds polled by Bank of America said that they had more of their portfolio allocated to stocks than at any time since 2006. All but one of the 13 bank strategists tracked by Birinyi Associates expects stock markets to rise in 2013. When 2012 began, the same strategists were predicting a downturn in share prices. Even among mutual fund investors, there are signs that the flows out of stocks and into bonds have been slowing down recently. The preference for bonds has already been costly for retail investors. Over the last year, most types of American bonds have returned less than an investment in the S.& P. 500. When inflation is factored in, the benchmark 10-year Treasury security is delivering negative returns. But many investors are still rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the turbulence in the stock markets since then, which have led to wild swings. Over the last five years, all major types of American bonds have done better than leading stock indexes. The Federal Reserve has been engaged in an aggressive effort to buy bonds and drive down interest rates. The long term goal of that program is to encourage banks to lend money and to drive investors out of bonds. But in the meantime, falling interest rates have made bonds more attractive. The Fed has said it wants to keep rates low until 2015, though it could let them rise sooner if the economy picks up faster than expected. The 10-year Treasury hovered near 4 percent in recent years but has stayed below 2 percent for much of 2012. A number of big-name investors say they believe that the low rates and economic uncertainty are likely to endure, giving bonds a continuing attraction. William H. Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, and perhaps the world's most famous bond investor, said on Twitter that he expected interest rates would fall further in 2013, in part because of continuing growing pains in the American economy. Mr. Gross's prediction is particularly notable because in 2011 he bet that interest rates would rise, leading him to sell off some of his firm's Treasury bond holdings. When that bet lost money, Mr. Gross reversed course. Garth Friesen, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund manager AVM, compared the current situation in the United States to the last few decades in Japan, where investors have continually predicted that interest rates will rise and drive down the value of Japanese bonds. Almost all of those predictions proved wrong as slow economic growth continued to push Japanese interest rates down. ''More money has been lost trying to predict the rotation out of Japanese bonds than almost anywhere else,'' said Mr. Friesen. But Mr. Friesen says he does believe that the returns from bonds will be lower than they have been in recent years. A Bank of America global bond index has returned 6 percent over the last year, 17 percent over the last three years and 32 percent since 2007. Most of the predictions that interest rates will stabilize or turn around are based on the belief that an improving American economy will help push unemployment lower, restore confidence in American companies and encourage inflation to start to rise. If inflation does go up, it will make current bond holdings less attractive. There is growing evidence this is already happening. In addition to the rising stock market, housing prices have begun to move up and unemployment has been trending down. Ms. Patterson said that this shift was likely to occur slowly, giving investors time to sell off their bond investments without sustaining any significant losses. What is more, a turn in interest rates will not cause the same problems for all bond holders. Investors who hold bonds directly will continue to collect regular interest payments and will receive back their entire initial investment, the principal, when the terms of the bonds expire. But for people who frequently buy and sell bonds, including mutual funds, the value of the bonds they currently hold will go down when interest rates rise. Even among bond mutual funds, some types are expected to continue to do well if and when interest rates rise. Bonds that are issued to provide loans to banks generally do well when rates rise. Among corporate bonds, investments in high-yielding speculative companies -- so-called junk bonds -- generally do better in times of rising rates than bonds issued by companies with high credit ratings. But all of this calculus could be thrown on its head if the doomsayers are right and interest rates rise quickly at some point. That could happen if, say, there were serious military tensions in the Middle East and oil prices spiked suddenly. It could also occur if investors lose faith in the ability of the United States government to pay back investors who buy its bonds. Tad Rivelle, the head of bond investing at TCW, said that the Federal Reserve's current policy was most likely to fail and kill confidence in Treasury bonds, forcing the government to pay higher interest rates to borrow. But even if the Fed succeeds, Mr. Rivelle said, interest rates will end up in the same place. ''Whether Fed policy succeeds or fails, rates are ultimately going to be going significantly higher,'' said Mr. Rivelle.
